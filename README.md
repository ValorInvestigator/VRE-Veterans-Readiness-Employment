## New: Know Exactly What Should Happen at Your Appointment

**[File 12 — VRC Intake Procedures](12_VRC_INTAKE_PROCEDURES.md)** is the counselor's side of the desk — what they're required to do, how they're supposed to act, what forms they fill out, and what goes wrong when they don't follow procedures. Sourced from 38 CFR, M28R/M28C manuals, VA OIG reports, and Congressional testimony.

**[File 13 — Your First Intake Meeting](13_FIRST_INTAKE_MEETING_OUTLINE.md)** is the veteran's walkthrough — a phase-by-phase outline of what's supposed to happen from the moment you walk in. Includes checklists for what to bring, red flags that your counselor is cutting corners, and a rights quick-reference table.

## Know What Your Counselor Is Supposed To Do

- **CRCC Ethics Code Section A** — Counselors must empower clients to make their own decisions
- **CRCC Ethics Code Section C** — Counselors MUST advocate at individual, group, and institutional levels
- **GAO-20-28 (2019)** — VR&E plans vary by counselor with no mechanism to detect inconsistency
- **VA OIG 23-03328-197 (2025)** — Counselor documentation so poor that decision accuracy "cannot be assessed"
- **VA OIG 23-00967-64 (2024)** — Counselors "generally unaware" of regulations, bypassed system controls
- **M28R/M28C manuals** — Internal procedures your VRC follows (or should be following)
- **Counselor caseload: 175+ cases each** — they're overwhelmed, which is why you need to advocate for yourself

## Key Regulations Every Veteran Should Know

- **38 CFR 21.50** — Your evaluation MUST cover 6 specific assessment areas
- **38 CFR 21.53** — *"Any reasonable doubt shall be resolved in favor of a finding of feasibility"*
- **38 CFR 21.257(d)(3)** — VA pays for *"license or required fees"* under self-employment
- **38 CFR 21.362** — VA staff must *"make a reasonable effort to inform the veteran and assure understanding"*
- **38 CFR 21.420** — Denials require 7 specific elements in writing; you get 30 days to respond
- **38 CFR 21.420(e)** — Favorable findings are **binding** on subsequent adjudicators
- **38 USC 3104(a)(15)** — Services include "other appropriate services" (the catch-all)

## Who This Is For

- Veterans preparing for a VR&E initial appointment
- Veterans who were denied and need to appeal
- Veterans pursuing self-employment or professional licensing
- Veteran advocates and VSO representatives
- Anyone who wants to understand what the VA actually owes under Chapter 31

## Disclaimer

This is research compiled from public law (38 USC), public regulations (38 CFR), VA policy manuals, and official VA sources. It is not legal advice. But it is the truth — and the truth is your best weapon at that appointment.
