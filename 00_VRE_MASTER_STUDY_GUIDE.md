## PART 1: WHAT VR&E IS (30-Second Version)

VR&E (Veterans Readiness and Employment) is a **Chapter 31 entitlement** — not a handout, not discretionary. If you qualify, the VA is **obligated by law** to provide it. It helps veterans with service-connected disabilities overcome employment barriers through training, education, equipment, monthly stipends, and business startup support.

**It is NOT just another GI Bill.** It is a **rehabilitation program**. Everything must connect back to overcoming employment barriers caused by your service-connected disabilities.

**Five tracks:** Reemployment | Rapid Access | Self-Employment | Long-Term Services (college) | Independent Living

---

## PART 2: DO YOU QUALIFY? (The Two Requirements)

### Requirement 1 — Discharge Status
- Honorable or General (Under Honorable) = YES
- OTH = MAYBE (VA can make a separate Character of Discharge determination)
- Dishonorable or Bad Conduct (General Court-Martial) = NO

### Requirement 2 — Service-Connected Disability Rating
| Your Rating | What You Need |
|---|---|
| **20% or higher** | Employment Handicap (EH) — standard bar |
| **10-19%** | Serious Employment Handicap (SEH) — higher bar |

### The 12-Year Delimiting Date
- Clock starts from date of separation OR date of first VA rating (whichever is LATER)
- **CRITICAL: If you separated on or after January 1, 2013, there is NO time limit** (VOW to Hire Heroes Act)
- Even for pre-2013: Serious Employment Handicap WAIVES the 12-year limit entirely

### Entitlement Period
- **48 months** of full-time equivalent services (vs 36 months GI Bill)
- Can be **extended beyond 48 months** with SEH finding
- Part-time extends proportionally (half-time = 96 calendar months)

---

## PART 3: EMPLOYMENT HANDICAP vs. SERIOUS EMPLOYMENT HANDICAP

**This is THE most important determination at your appointment.**

### Employment Handicap (EH) — 38 CFR 21.51
Three conditions, ALL must be met:
1. You have an impairment to your ability to prepare for, obtain, or retain suitable employment
2. Your service-connected disability CONTRIBUTES to this impairment (doesn't have to be the sole cause)
3. You have NOT already overcome this impairment through current suitable employment

### Serious Employment Handicap (SEH) — 38 CFR 21.52
Same three conditions, but the impairment must be **SIGNIFICANT**. VRC evaluates:
- Number and severity of disabling conditions
- Whether neuropsychiatric conditions exist (PTSD, depression, TBI, anxiety)
- Adequacy of education/training
- Periods of unemployment or underemployment
- History of relying on government support (disability comp, unemployment, SNAP)
- Complexity of services needed

### Automatic/Presumptive SEH Findings
| Situation | Result |
|---|---|
| 50%+ combined rating | Strong presumption toward SEH |
| 30%+ neuropsychiatric condition | SEH typically found AUTOMATICALLY |
| 30-40% with complicating factors | SEH may be found |
| Below 30% with documented unemployment patterns | SEH CAN still be found |

### Why SEH Matters Even If You're Over 20%
SEH unlocks two major extras:
1. **12-year delimiting date completely waived**
2. **48-month entitlement can be extended** — no hard cap

---

## PART 4: YOUR APPOINTMENT TOMORROW — WHAT HAPPENS

### Part A: Orientation (30-60 min)
- Group or individual session — overview of VR&E program
- Videos, slides, program explanation
- Take notes on expectations and rules

### Part B: Initial Evaluation (60-90 min) — THE CRITICAL MEETING
Your Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) will:
1. Review your service history and discharge
2. Review your disability rating (every rated condition)
3. Review medical records
4. Discuss employment history (jobs, why you left, problems)
5. Discuss education and training
6. Discuss your career goals
7. Assess interests, aptitudes, abilities
8. **Make the EH/SEH determination**
9. Determine feasibility of your vocational goal
10. Discuss which track is appropriate

### Assessment Tools They May Use
- **VA Form 28-1902w** (Rehabilitation Needs Inventory) — comprehensive questionnaire
- **CareerScope** — aptitude and interest assessment (may get link via email before appointment)
- **O*NET Interest Profiler** — career interest inventory
- **Transferable Skills Analysis** — military skills to civilian careers
- **Labor Market Analysis** — job prospects in your area

### The "Reasonable Doubt" Standard — YOUR STRONGEST WEAPON
> **38 CFR 21.53(d): "Any reasonable doubt shall be resolved in favor of a finding of feasibility."**

This means if the VRC is on the fence, the law says they MUST decide in YOUR favor. A finding of infeasibility requires "compelling evidence **beyond any reasonable doubt**." This is one of the strongest pro-veteran standards in all of VA law.

---

## PART 5: WHAT TO BRING TOMORROW

### Essential
- [ ] **DD-214** (Member 4 copy preferred)
- [ ] **VA disability rating decision letter** (most current, showing combined % and each condition)
- [ ] **Current resume** (even rough — chronological employment with dates and reasons for leaving)
- [ ] **Employment history** — dates, positions, WHY you left each job (especially disability-related)

### Strongly Recommended
- [ ] Medical records related to SC conditions
- [ ] Letters from doctors describing how conditions affect work ability
- [ ] Documentation of failed employment attempts (terminations, performance issues)
- [ ] Written career goals (why PI work, how it accommodates your disabilities)
- [ ] Records of government assistance relied on (supports SEH finding)
- [ ] Academic transcripts (if any)

### PI-Specific
- [ ] Notes on your PI business concept
- [ ] Oregon PI license requirements printout (ORS 703)
- [ ] Market research on PI demand in Eastern Oregon
- [ ] Any military investigative or security experience documentation

---

## PART 6: WHAT TO SAY AND WHAT NOT TO SAY

### DO Say
**Connect EVERY SC disability to specific employment barriers:**
- "My [condition] prevents me from [specific work activity], which eliminates [type of jobs]"
- "I was fired from [job] after [time] because my [condition] caused [specific problem]"
- "I have not been able to hold a job for more than [X months] because of [conditions]"

**Be specific about your goal:**
- "I want to pursue self-employment as a Private Investigator because the flexible schedule accommodates my [conditions], the independent nature of the work suits my [abilities], and the analytical/investigative skills align with my military training in [MOS/specialty]"

**Describe your worst days honestly:**
- If there are days you can't function, say so
- If pain prevents concentration, explain severity and frequency
- This is NOT the time to be stoic

### DO NOT Say
- ❌ "I just want to use my GI Bill" — VR&E is rehabilitation, not education
- ❌ "I'm fine, I just need some help" — this = no employment handicap
- ❌ "I don't know what I want to do" — have a clear goal
- ❌ Don't downplay disabilities — the VRC evaluates barriers; if you say you're fine, they'll agree
- ❌ Don't be combative — the VRC should be your ally
- ❌ Don't exaggerate — medical records will contradict you

---

## PART 7: THE SELF-EMPLOYMENT TRACK (Track 3) — YOUR TRACK

### Can VR&E Fund a PI License and Business? **YES.**

**38 CFR 21.257(d)(3)** explicitly lists "license or required fees" as authorized self-employment expenses. The regulation is occupation-agnostic — any legal self-employment that passes feasibility.

### What VR&E Will Cover for Your PI Business

| Item | Covered? | Regulation |
|------|----------|-----------|
| PI training courses (DPSST-approved) | **YES** | 38 CFR 21.257(d)(1) |
| Oregon DPSST application fee ($74) | **YES** | 38 CFR 21.257(d)(3) |
| Oregon DPSST licensing fee ($690) | **YES** | 38 CFR 21.257(d)(3) |
| Fingerprinting/background check | **LIKELY** | 38 CFR 21.257(d)(3) |
| Surety bond ($5,000 min) | **LIKELY** | Required for ORS 703.415(2)(b) |
| Competency exam fees | **YES** | 38 CFR 21.257(d)(3) |
| Surveillance equipment (cameras, lenses) | **YES** | 38 CFR 21.257(d)(4)-(5) |
| Computers and software | **YES** | General VR&E supply provision |
| Business management training | **YES** | 38 CFR 21.257(d)(1) |
| Office equipment (desk, printer, etc.) | **YES** | 38 CFR 21.257(d)(4)-(5) |
| Vehicle purchase | **NO** | 38 CFR 21.214 — explicitly prohibited |
| Office lease/rent | **NO** | 38 CFR 21.214 — explicitly prohibited |
| Land or buildings | **NO** | 38 CFR 21.214 — explicitly prohibited |

### The Three Self-Employment Categories

| Category | Scale | Approval | Timeline | Approx. Threshold |
|----------|-------|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **I** | Large | Regional + Central Office DC | 9-14 months total | ~$25,000+ |
| **II** | Small/Micro | Regional only (VRC + VREO) | 4-8 months total | Under ~$25,000 |
| **III** | Home micro | VRC + VREO concurrence | Fastest | Minimal costs |

### The Provisional License Strategy (RECOMMENDED)

Oregon offers a **Provisional PI License** — no 1,500 hours experience required upfront:

**Phase 1 (Months 1-6):** VR&E funds PI training + licensing → Provisional license obtained
**Phase 2 (Months 6-18):** Work for established PI firm → Accumulate 1,500 hours → VR&E pays subsistence
**Phase 3 (Months 18-24):** Upgrade to full license → VR&E procures equipment → Launch business

**Why this works:** Demonstrates commitment, reduces risk, satisfies feasibility, allows Category II (faster) start while building toward full business.

### Oregon PI License Requirements (ORS 703)
- **DPSST** is the licensing authority
- **$764 total** ($74 application + $690 license)
- Must pass competency exam
- Fingerprinting required
- Surety bond or E&O insurance ($5,000 min)
- **Military training and experience count** — ORS 703.415 explicitly says "relevant training and experience obtained in the military, approved by the department"

## PART 8: SUBSISTENCE ALLOWANCE — THE MONEY

### Current Rates (FY2026, effective Oct 1, 2025) — 2.5% COLA increase

**Institutional Training / Self-Employment Training Phase:**

| Training Time | No Dependents | 1 Dependent | 2 Dependents | Each Additional |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Full-Time** | **$812.84/mo** | **$1,008.24/mo** | **$1,188.15/mo** | **+$86.58** |
| **3/4 Time** | **$610.76** | **$757.28** | **$888.32** | **+$66.60** |
| **1/2 Time** | **$408.66** | **$506.32** | **$595.16** | **+$44.42** |

**If eligible for Post-9/11 GI Bill:** You may elect BAH rate instead — often HIGHER depending on location.

**Paid OJT / Apprenticeship:** $710.67/mo (no dependents, full-time)

### Additional Financial Support
- Books, supplies, equipment — **paid in full by VA** (not from subsistence)
- Transportation assistance in some cases
- Employment Adjustment Allowance — up to 2 months after program completion
- Work-study available for additional income

### Key Rule
- Subsistence paid during business plan development, training, planning phase

## PART 10: MYTHS YOUR VRC MIGHT TELL YOU (ALL FALSE)

| What They Say | The Truth |
|---|---|
| "VR&E doesn't pay for graduate school" | **FALSE** — VR&E has funded JD, MD, PhD, MBA programs |
| "Self-employment isn't approved" | **FALSE** — It's one of the 5 official tracks |
| "We can only fund 4-year programs" | **FALSE** — Extensions available, especially with SEH |
| "You have to take the first job offer" | **FALSE** — Must be "suitable employment" matching your abilities |
| "We don't buy computers" | **MISLEADING** — Routinely approved; if denied, appeal |
| "Pick from this approved list" | **FALSE** — No master list exists; you choose your goal |
| "You already used VR&E, can't come back" | **FALSE** — Changed circumstances allow re-application |

**When they say something is "not allowed," respond:** *"Can you cite the specific regulation that prohibits this?"*

---

## PART 11: KEY PHRASES TO USE AT YOUR APPOINTMENT

**On plan development:**
> "I have the right to participate in the development of my rehabilitation plan under 38 CFR 21.80 through 21.98."

**On feasibility:**
> "Under 38 CFR 21.53, any reasonable doubt must be resolved in favor of a finding of feasibility."

**On program choice:**
> "Can you cite the specific regulation that prohibits this program?"

**On appeals:**
> "I would like to receive this decision in writing with the specific reasons and my appeal options, as required by 38 CFR 21.420."

**On supervisory review:**
> "I would like to speak with the VR&E Officer about this decision."

**On self-employment:**
> "Self-employment is one of the five authorized VR&E tracks under 38 CFR 21.257. I'd like to explore that option."

---

## PART 12: YOUR PI BUSINESS PITCH — WHAT TO TELL THE VRC

### The Elevator Pitch
"I'm pursuing self-employment as a licensed Private Investigator in Oregon. My military background gave me investigative, analytical, and surveillance skills directly applicable to PI work. My service-connected disabilities make traditional 9-to-5 employment difficult, but the flexible schedule, independent nature, and physical variability of PI work accommodates my conditions. Eastern Oregon has limited PI coverage, creating strong market demand. Oregon law specifically recognizes military training and experience as qualifying for PI licensure. I plan to start with a provisional license to gain documented experience, then launch my own firm. The startup costs are manageable, the market is underserved, and this career path directly leverages my service-developed skills."

### Why PI Work Accommodates Disabilities
- **Flexible schedule** — you set your own hours, can work around medical appointments and bad days
- **Independent work** — no crowded office environments, no difficult coworkers (PTSD-friendly)
- **Variable physical demands** — mix of desk work (research, reports) and field work (surveillance), allowing position changes
- **Mental engagement** — analytical/investigative work engages cognitive skills without physical strain
- **Self-paced** — control workload based on capacity

### Market Data for Eastern Oregon
- Fewer PIs in rural Oregon = less competition
- Attorney demand for process service, witness location, investigation
- Insurance fraud investigation = growing market
- Rates: $50-$125/hour depending on service type
- Retained attorney contracts: $2,000-$10,000+/month

## PART 13: VR&E vs. GI BILL — KEY DIFFERENCES

| Feature | VR&E (Chapter 31) | Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33) |
|---|---|---|
| Entitlement | **48 months** | 36 months |
| Tuition | **Paid in full** — no cap | Caps vary by school type |
| Books/Supplies | **Paid by VA directly** | $1,000/year stipend |
| Monthly Stipend | Subsistence allowance ($813-$1,188+) | BAH rate (location-based) |
| Equipment | **VA provides** (computers, tools) | Not covered |
| Self-Employment | **YES — full track** | No |
| Job Placement | **YES — 18 months post-completion** | No |
| Graduate School | **YES** | YES |
| Extensions | **YES with SEH** | Limited |
| Counselor | **Assigned VRC** | None |

**Can you switch from GI Bill to VR&E?** YES. If you have remaining GI Bill entitlement, VR&E may be better. Your VRC can help determine which is more advantageous. Prior GI Bill usage may count against the 48-month cap but can potentially be restored.

---

## PART 14: CRITICAL WARNINGS

### DO NOT sign an IWRP that doesn't list self-employment as THE vocational goal
If you sign a plan for traditional employment first, switching to self-employment later requires amending the entire plan — some VRCs will resist this. **Self-employment must be the stated vocational goal from day one.**

### DO NOT buy anything before VRC approval
Every single purchase must be pre-approved. No retroactive reimbursement.

### DO NOT agree to something you don't understand
You are NOT required to sign on the spot. Say "I need time to review this" if pressured.

### DO take notes during the meeting
Document what the VRC says, what was decided, and any commitments made.

### DO get everything in writing
If denied anything, ask: "Will I receive this decision in writing with the specific reasons for denial and my appeal rights?"
