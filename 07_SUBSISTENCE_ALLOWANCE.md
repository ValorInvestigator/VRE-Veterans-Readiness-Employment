## 1. CURRENT SUBSISTENCE ALLOWANCE RATES (FY2026)

Effective October 1, 2025. Reflects a **2.5% COLA increase** over FY2025 rates.

### 1A. INSTITUTIONAL TRAINING

Applies to: College, university, trade school, vocational school, nonpay or nominal pay work experience, and Improvement of Rehabilitation Potential (IRP) programs.

| Training Time | No Dependents | 1 Dependent | 2 Dependents | Each Additional Dependent |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Full-Time** | **$812.84** | **$1,008.24** | **$1,188.15** | **+$86.58** |
| **3/4 Time** | **$610.76** | **$757.28** | **$888.32** | **+$66.60** |
| **1/2 Time** | **$408.66** | **$506.32** | **$595.16** | **+$44.42** |
| **1/4 Time** | **$204.30** | **$253.20** | **$297.59** | **+$22.16** |

**Note:** Quarter-time (1/4 time) rates are available ONLY for Extended Evaluation programs.

### 1B. NONPAY OR NOMINAL PAY ON-JOB TRAINING, HOME TRAINING, VOCATIONAL COURSE, INDEPENDENT INSTRUCTOR

| Training Time | No Dependents | 1 Dependent | 2 Dependents | Each Additional Dependent |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Full-Time ONLY** | **$812.84** | **$1,008.24** | **$1,188.15** | **+$86.58** |

These categories pay the same rates as institutional training but are restricted to full-time participation only.

### 1C. FARM COOPERATIVE, APPRENTICESHIP, OR OTHER PAID ON-JOB TRAINING (OJT)

| Training Time | No Dependents | 1 Dependent | 2 Dependents | Each Additional Dependent |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Full-Time ONLY** | **$710.67** | **$859.43** | **$990.47** | **+$64.41** |

**Critical Rule:** For paid OJT, the veteran's training wage PLUS the subsistence allowance CANNOT exceed the normal journeyman wage for that occupation. If the combined amount would exceed the journeyman wage, the subsistence allowance is reduced accordingly.

### 1D. COMBINATION TRAINING

When a rehabilitation plan combines institutional training with OJT, the rate depends on which component constitutes more than 50% of the training:

| Combination Type | No Dependents | 1 Dependent | 2 Dependents | Each Additional |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Institutional >50%** (or non-farm coop/institutional) | $812.84 | $1,008.24 | $1,188.15 | +$86.58 |
| **On-Job >50%** (or non-farm coop/on-job) | $710.67 | $859.43 | $990.47 | +$64.41 |

### 1E. INDEPENDENT LIVING

Per 38 CFR 21.266, veterans in Independent Living programs receive the **same rate as institutional training** (see table 1A above). Payment is based on rate of participation (full-time, 3/4 time, 1/2 time).

### 1F. EXTENDED EVALUATION

Paid at **institutional training rates** (see table 1A). This is the ONLY program category where quarter-time (1/4 time) rates are available.

### 1G. SELF-EMPLOYMENT TRACK

During the training/preparation phase of the self-employment track (business courses, business plan development, market analysis), subsistence is paid at the **institutional training rate** (see table 1A). The VA does NOT provide direct cash startup capital, but DOES provide supplies, equipment, and tools through purchase orders (see Section 7 below).

### 1H. MAXIMUM MONTHLY SUBSISTENCE

The theoretical maximum monthly subsistence allowance for FY2026 is **$3,439.23**, calculated for a veteran enrolled full-time with the following dependents: spouse, mother, father, and 25 children.

---

## 2. PRIOR YEAR RATES (FY2025) FOR COMPARISON

Effective October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025. Reflected a **3.2% COLA increase** over FY2024.

### FY2025 INSTITUTIONAL TRAINING RATES

| Training Time | No Dependents | 1 Dependent | 2 Dependents | Each Additional Dependent |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Full-Time** | **$793.01** | **$983.65** | **$1,159.17** | **+$84.47** |
| **3/4 Time** | **$595.89** | **$738.87** | **$866.74** | **+$64.97** |

|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Full-Time ONLY** | **$693.45** | **$838.59** | **$966.38** | **+$62.84** |

FY2025 maximum monthly rate: **$3,355.39**

### Rate Increase Comparison (FY2025 to FY2026)

| Category (Full-Time, No Deps) | FY2025 | FY2026 | Increase |
|---|---|---|---|
| Institutional | $793.01 | $812.84 | +$19.83 (+2.5%) |
| Paid OJT/Farm Coop | $693.45 | $710.67 | +$17.22 (+2.5%) |

## 3. RATE CATEGORIES EXPLAINED

### Institutional Training
The most common track. Covers enrollment at colleges, universities, trade schools, and vocational schools. Supports full-time, three-quarter time, half-time, and (for Extended Evaluation only) quarter-time participation. The VRC and veteran develop an IWRP (Individualized Written Rehabilitation Plan) that specifies the training program.

### Nonpay/Nominal Pay On-the-Job Training
On-the-job training where the employer pays nothing or a token amount. Rates match institutional training but are restricted to full-time only. The veteran gains work experience while receiving the subsistence allowance.

### Home Training / Independent Instructor / Vocational Course
Training conducted in the veteran's home or with an independent instructor. Same rates as institutional training, full-time only. May be used for veterans with severe disabilities that prevent attending a facility.

### Farm Cooperative / Apprenticeship / Paid OJT
Any on-the-job training where the employer pays a training wage. The subsistence allowance rate is LOWER than institutional because the veteran is earning wages. The combined wage + subsistence cannot exceed the journeyman wage for the occupation.

### Combination Training
Plans that blend institutional and OJT components. The component that constitutes more than 50% of total training hours determines which rate table applies.

### Independent Living
For veterans with serious employment handicaps for whom employment is not currently reasonably feasible. Focuses on achieving maximum independence in daily living. Paid at institutional training rates.

### Extended Evaluation
A period (up to 12 months, extendable to 24) where the VA evaluates whether a veteran can benefit from rehabilitation services. Paid at institutional rates. The ONLY category with quarter-time rates.

### Self-Employment
For veterans who want to start their own business. During training (business courses, MBA programs, entrepreneurship training), subsistence is paid at institutional rates. Post-training, the VA provides equipment, supplies, and technical assistance through purchase orders but does NOT provide direct cash for startup capital.

---

## 4. HOW RATES ARE CALCULATED

### Base Rate Determination
Subsistence allowance rates are set by federal statute (38 USC 3108) and published annually by the VA. The rates are **uniform nationwide** -- they are NOT based on geographic location (unlike the Post-9/11 GI Bill BAH). A veteran in New York City receives the same Chapter 31 subsistence as a veteran in rural Oregon.

### Dependent Additions
Your rate increases with each qualifying dependent:
- **Spouse** = counts as 1 dependent
- **Each child** = counts as 1 dependent
- **Dependent parent(s)** = each counts as 1 dependent
- The "1 Dependent" column covers the first dependent regardless of type
- The "2 Dependents" column covers any two dependents
- The "Each Additional Dependent" add-on applies starting with the 3rd dependent

**Example calculation for FY2026 institutional full-time:**
- Veteran with spouse + 3 children (4 total dependents):
  - Base for 2 dependents: $1,188.15
  - Plus 2 additional dependents: 2 x $86.58 = $173.16
  - **Total: $1,361.31/month**

### Annual COLA Adjustments
Rates are adjusted every **October 1** at the start of the federal fiscal year. The adjustment is based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Recent COLA history:

| Fiscal Year | Effective Date | COLA Increase |
|---|---|---|
| FY2026 | October 1, 2025 | +2.5% |
| FY2025 | October 1, 2024 | +3.2% |
| FY2024 | October 1, 2023 | +3.2% |
| FY2023 | October 1, 2022 | +8.7% |
| FY2022 | October 1, 2021 | +1.3% |

### Location-Based?
**NO.** The standard Chapter 31 subsistence allowance is the same amount regardless of where you live or attend training. This is a key difference from the Post-9/11 GI Bill.

**EXCEPTION:** If you elect to receive the Post-9/11 GI Bill housing rate instead of the standard Chapter 31 subsistence (see Section 8), THEN the payment becomes location-based (BAH for E-5 with dependents at your school's ZIP code).

---

## 5. PAYMENT MECHANICS

### When Payments Start
Subsistence payments begin after:
1. Your VRC approves your rehabilitation plan (IWRP)
2. You begin your approved training program
3. Your enrollment is certified by the school or training provider

Your first payment typically arrives **the month AFTER** your first month of training because payments are made in arrears.

### How Payments Are Made
**Direct deposit** to your bank account. Set up through VA.gov or your VRC. There is no option for paper checks in most cases.

### Payment Schedule
**Monthly, paid in arrears.** You receive payment at the end of the month or beginning of the following month for training completed during the prior month. The VA processes payments through the same system used for disability compensation (VBA financial systems).

### Between Programs
If there is a gap between training programs (e.g., between semesters where you are not enrolled), subsistence payments **STOP**. They resume when you resume certified training. Summer breaks where you are not enrolled typically mean no subsistence payment for those months unless you are enrolled in summer courses.

### Advance Payment
Available under **38 CFR 21.332**. You may request an advance payment of your subsistence allowance. This can help bridge the gap before your first regular payment arrives. Approval is at the VA's discretion, and you should specifically ask your VRC about this option. The advance is later recouped from future payments.

### Work-Study Additional Payments
Chapter 31 veterans are eligible for the **VA Work-Study Program** (38 USC 3485). Details:
- **Hourly rate:** The GREATER of federal minimum wage ($7.25/hr) or your state minimum wage
- **If the school pays more:** The school may pay the difference between the VA rate and their usual rate for that position
- **Hours limit:** Cannot work more than 25 hours per week multiplied by the number of weeks in your enrollment period
- **Advance available:** You may receive an advance of **40% of your total Work-Study agreement hours** or **50 hours** (whichever is less)
- **Ongoing payment:** After working off your advance, you are paid each time you complete 50 hours of service
- **Types of work:** Must be VA-related (VA medical centers, VA offices, campus veteran services, etc.)

### Tax Status
Subsistence allowance is **100% TAX-FREE.** It is not reportable income. It does not need to appear on your tax return.

### Stacking with Disability Compensation
The subsistence allowance is paid **ON TOP OF** your VA disability compensation. They are completely separate payments from separate VA systems. Receiving one does NOT reduce the other.

### Part-Time Entitlement
Per veteran benefit knowledge bases, even if you are enrolled **less than half-time, you ARE entitled to your subsistence allowance.** The amount is prorated based on your training time (see the 1/4 time row for Extended Evaluation, or the 1/2 time row for other programs).

---

## 6. EMPLOYMENT ADJUSTMENT ALLOWANCE

### Legal Authority
38 CFR 21.268 (Post-Employment Allowance)

### What It Is
A continuation payment of the subsistence allowance AFTER you complete your rehabilitation program and reach employability. It is designed to provide financial support during the transition from training to employment.

### How Much
Paid at the **full-time subsistence allowance rate** for the type of program you completed. Examples:
- Completed institutional training, single, no dependents: **$812.84/month**
- Completed institutional training, married (1 dependent): **$1,008.24/month**
- Completed paid OJT, single, no dependents: **$710.67/month**

**Important:** If your program was OJT, farm cooperative, home training, independent instructor, or self-employment, the employment adjustment allowance is paid at the **INSTITUTIONAL** subsistence rate (the higher rate), NOT the OJT rate. This benefits veterans who completed lower-paying training tracks.

### Duration
**Standard: 2 months** of continued subsistence payments after program completion.

**Disaster Extension:** If you are displaced by a natural or other disaster while receiving the employment adjustment allowance, you may receive up to an **additional 2 months** (total of up to 4 months) if you are satisfactorily following an employment services program.

### When It Kicks In
**Immediately** upon completion of rehabilitation to the point of employability. There is no waiting period. You must be actively seeking employment (your VRC may require proof of active job applications).

### Entitlement Charge
The employment adjustment allowance does **NOT** count against your basic 48-month VR&E entitlement. These are free additional months of payment beyond your entitlement.

---

## 7. ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT

### 7A. Books and Supplies
- **Covered:** Textbooks, course materials, supplies required by your program
- **How provided:** VA pays directly via Purchase Order (PO) to the school bookstore or vendor
- **Process:** Your VRC authorizes the specific items. A PO is issued with line items and dollar amounts
- **Critical rule:** Do NOT buy out of pocket and expect reimbursement. Get the purchase order FIRST, then use it to obtain your materials
- **Compared to GI Bill:** The Post-9/11 GI Bill provides a flat $1,000/year book stipend. VR&E has no fixed cap -- it covers whatever books and supplies your program requires

### 7B. Computer and Technology
- **Covered items (case-by-case, requires VRC approval):**
  - Laptop or desktop computer
  - Printer
  - Scanner
  - External hard drive
  - Software (including Microsoft Office)
  - Specialized software required by your program
  - Internet service (in some cases)
  - Assistive technology devices
- **One-time provision:** The VA will generally only provide non-consumable items ONCE
- **Replacement:** If lost, stolen, or damaged through no fault of your own, replacement may be authorized
- **How obtained:** Through purchase order, not reimbursement

### 7C. Tools and Equipment
- Professional tools required for your training program
- Examples: instruments, cameras, specialized equipment for your field
- Provided through purchase orders
- Remain the property of the veteran after successful rehabilitation

### 7D. Specialized Clothing
- Lab coats, chef's uniforms, steel-toe boots, hard hats, protective gear
- Safety glasses, hearing protection
- Any clothing REQUIRED by your training program
- **NOT covered:** General everyday clothing, business attire (unless specifically required by an OJT placement)

### 7E. Transportation
- **Parking passes** at your school or training site
- **Transit passes** (bus, light rail, etc.)
- **Mileage reimbursement** for travel to and from training (in some cases)
- **Inter-facility travel** to VA medical appointments related to your rehabilitation
- Added as line items on your purchase order with specific dollar amounts
- Amount varies by location and VRC authorization

### 7F. Dental Care
- For the **entire duration** of your VR&E program
- Condition: Must be determined that dental work is **necessary to develop, carry out, and complete** the rehabilitation plan
- Examples: A veteran in a customer-facing field who needs dental work to be employable
- Provided through VA dental clinics or authorized community care

### 7G. Tutoring
- Can be authorized if needed for your program success
- Your VRC evaluates the need and approves specific tutoring services
- Typically arranged through the school or an approved tutor

### 7H. Adaptive Automobile Allowance
- Available for qualifying veterans with certain service-connected disabilities
- Separate application process from VR&E subsistence
- Can cover vehicle modifications or a one-time automobile grant

### 7I. Reader/Interpreter Services
- For veterans who are blind, deaf, or have other disabilities requiring these services
- Provided as part of the rehabilitation plan

### 7J. Emergency Financial Assistance
- NOT a standard VR&E benefit
- However, your VRC can sometimes expedite payments or connect you with other VA resources (e.g., VA emergency funds, veteran service organization assistance)
- If you are in financial crisis, inform your VRC immediately

### 7K. Relocation/Move Assistance
- Not a standard published VR&E benefit
- Some VRCs may authorize reasonable relocation costs if moving is REQUIRED to attend your approved program
- Highly case-by-case and dependent on your VRC

### 7L. KEY RULE FOR ALL SUPPLIES AND SERVICES
**ALL supplies, equipment, and services require VRC pre-approval.** Items are procured through the VA purchase order system. Never purchase anything out of pocket expecting reimbursement unless you have explicit written authorization from your VRC to do so.

## 8. COMPARISON WITH POST-9/11 GI BILL

### 8A. The Election (CRITICAL)
If you are eligible for BOTH VR&E (Chapter 31) AND the Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33), you have a choice:

**Option A -- Standard Chapter 31 Subsistence:**
- Flat national rate (see tables in Section 1)
- Same amount regardless of location
- Lower in high-cost areas, potentially competitive in very low-cost areas

**Option B -- Post-9/11 GI Bill Housing Rate:**
- BAH (Basic Allowance for Housing) at the E-5 with dependents rate for your school's ZIP code
- Location-based: higher in expensive cities, lower in rural areas
- Generally significantly more than the standard Chapter 31 rate in most metro areas

**Requirements to elect the Post-9/11 rate:**
1. Have at least 1 day of Post-9/11 GI Bill entitlement remaining
2. Be within your Post-9/11 GI Bill eligibility period
3. Formally elect the Post-9/11 rate through your VRC

**Ask your VRC for a written side-by-side comparison** for your specific school location before choosing.

### 8B. Side-by-Side Rate Comparison Examples (FY2026)

| Location | Ch. 31 Standard (Full-Time, 1 Dep) | Post-9/11 BAH (E-5 w/Dep) | Difference |
|---|---|---|---|
| Portland, OR (97201) | $1,008.24 | ~$2,250/month | ~+$1,242 GI Bill advantage |
| La Grande, OR (97850) | $1,008.24 | ~$1,200/month | ~+$192 GI Bill advantage |
| San Francisco, CA | $1,008.24 | ~$3,600/month | ~+$2,592 GI Bill advantage |
| Rural Oklahoma | $1,008.24 | ~$1,050/month | ~+$42 GI Bill advantage |
| Online-only (no campus) | $1,008.24 | ~$988/month (national avg) | Ch. 31 may be higher |

**Note:** Post-9/11 BAH amounts are approximate and change annually. Check the VA GI Bill Rate Tables at va.gov for exact amounts by ZIP code.

### 8C. Advantages of VR&E Over GI Bill

| Feature | VR&E (Chapter 31) | Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33) |
|---|---|---|
| **Tuition** | 100% paid, NO CAP | Capped at ~$28,937.94/yr for private schools (FY2026) |
| **Books/Supplies** | Covered in full via purchase order | Flat $1,000/year stipend |
| **Computer/Equipment** | Provided if program requires | Not covered |
| **Entitlement** | Up to 48 months | 36 months |
| **Dental care** | YES (during program) | NO |
| **Employment adjustment** | 2 months post-graduation pay | Nothing |
| **Eligibility time limit** | No limit (post-Jan 2013 separees) | 15 years |
| **Disability rating required** | YES (minimum 10%) | NO (but need qualifying service) |
| **Monthly housing payment** | Flat national rate (or elect GI Bill BAH) | Location-based BAH |
| **Tax status** | Tax-free | Tax-free |
| **Tutoring** | Can be authorized | Not typically covered |

### 8D. Can You Switch from GI Bill to VR&E?
**YES.** You can stop using your GI Bill at any time and apply for VR&E if you qualify (10%+ service-connected disability rating plus an employment handicap determination).

### 8E. Month-for-Month Charge Rules (CRITICAL -- 2021 POLICY CHANGE)

**Old Rule (Before April 1, 2021):**
- Every month of VR&E usage was charged against your 48-month combined education benefit cap
- This reduced your remaining GI Bill months
- Many veterans exhausted their GI Bill without knowing

**New Rule (Effective April 1, 2021):**
- **VR&E usage does NOT count against your Post-9/11 GI Bill entitlement**
- Using Chapter 31 will NOT reduce your Chapter 33 months
- This was a major policy change that benefits veterans significantly

**HOWEVER -- the reverse DOES apply:**
- If you used GI Bill FIRST, those months ARE deducted from your 48-month VR&E entitlement
- The 48-month cap (38 USC 3695) still applies to the TOTAL of all VA education benefits combined

**Optimal Strategy:**
1. Use VR&E (Chapter 31) FIRST -- it does NOT reduce your GI Bill months
2. If you still have GI Bill months remaining after VR&E, you can use those separately afterward
3. This effectively maximizes your total education benefit

### 8F. Retroactive Induction
If a veteran exhausted their GI Bill before applying for VR&E, retroactive induction into VR&E may restore some of the GI Bill entitlement that was used. This is a complex process -- work with your VRC and a VSO.

### 8G. Cannot Use Both Simultaneously
You CANNOT receive both VR&E subsistence and GI Bill BAH at the same time for the same enrollment period. You choose one or the other (standard Chapter 31 rate OR the Post-9/11 GI Bill BAH rate through VR&E).

## 9. QUICK REFERENCE FOR COUNSELOR APPOINTMENT

### Most Common Scenario: Veteran Attending College Full-Time (FY2026)

| Family Situation | Monthly Subsistence | Annual (10 months) |
|---|---|---|
| Single, no dependents | $812.84 | $8,128.40 |
| Married, no children (1 dep) | $1,008.24 | $10,082.40 |
| Married + 1 child (2 deps) | $1,188.15 | $11,881.50 |
| Married + 2 children (3 deps) | $1,274.73 | $12,747.30 |
| Married + 3 children (4 deps) | $1,361.31 | $13,613.10 |
| Married + 4 children (5 deps) | $1,447.89 | $14,478.90 |

### What VR&E Pays IN ADDITION TO Monthly Subsistence
- 100% tuition (no cap, unlike GI Bill)
- Books and supplies (purchase order, no fixed cap)
- Computer/laptop if program requires it (purchase order)
- Required specialized clothing/equipment (purchase order)
- Transportation assistance (parking, transit passes)
- Dental care (if needed for rehabilitation)
- Tutoring (if needed)
- 2 months employment adjustment allowance after graduation

### What VR&E Does NOT Provide
- Direct cash for startup capital (self-employment track provides equipment/supplies instead)
- General everyday clothing
- Housing beyond the subsistence allowance
- Childcare (though VRC may know of other VA/community resources)
- General living expenses beyond subsistence

### Questions to Ask Your VRC at the Appointment
1. "Can you calculate a side-by-side comparison of the standard Chapter 31 rate versus the Post-9/11 BAH rate for my specific school?"
2. "What is the process for getting a laptop and required software through a purchase order?"
3. "How do I request advance payment to bridge the gap before my first regular payment?"
4. "Am I eligible for the VA Work-Study program in addition to my subsistence?"
5. "What transportation support is available (parking pass, transit pass)?"
6. "How does the employment adjustment allowance work after I complete my program?"
7. "Does using VR&E affect my remaining GI Bill entitlement?" (Answer should be NO under the 2021 rule)
8. "What dental care am I entitled to during my program?"
