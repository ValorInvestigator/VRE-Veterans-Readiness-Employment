## 1. PROGRAM OVERVIEW

VR&E (Veteran Readiness and Employment), also called Chapter 31, is a VA program that helps veterans with service-connected disabilities prepare for, find, and maintain suitable employment. It is authorized under Title 38, U.S. Code, Chapter 31.

VR&E is NOT merely an education benefit. It is a vocational REHABILITATION program. The VA considers it a pathway to overcome employment barriers caused by service-connected disabilities. This distinction matters because the VRC will evaluate you through the lens of rehabilitation, not just education.

The program can provide:
- Career counseling and planning
- Training and education (tuition, fees, books, supplies paid in full)
- Monthly subsistence allowance during training
- Employment assistance (resume help, job placement, interview coaching)
- Post-employment follow-up (up to 18 months after placement)
- Self-employment assistance (business plans, startup costs, equipment)
- Independent living services (for those who cannot work immediately)
- Assistive technology and workplace accommodations

**Key distinction -- "Eligible" vs. "Entitled":**
- **Eligible** = You meet the basic requirements to APPLY (service-connected disability + qualifying discharge). This gets you in the door for an evaluation.
- **Entitled** = The VRC has determined you have an Employment Handicap (EH) or Serious Employment Handicap (SEH) and you qualify for actual program services. This is the determination made AT your appointment.

---

## 2. BASIC ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS

### Two Core Requirements (BOTH Must Be Met)

#### Requirement 1 -- Discharge Status

You must NOT have a dishonorable discharge. Qualifying statuses include:

| Discharge Type | Eligible? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Honorable | YES | No issues |
| General (Under Honorable Conditions) | YES | No issues |
| Other Than Honorable (OTH) | MAYBE | Requires VA Character of Discharge determination. VA can determine you are eligible for VA benefits WITHOUT changing your DD-214. This is a separate process from a military discharge upgrade. |
| Bad Conduct (Special Court-Martial) | MAYBE | Same as OTH -- requires VA character of discharge review |
| Bad Conduct (General Court-Martial) | NO | Statutory bar |
| Dishonorable | NO | Statutory bar |

**Exception for discharge issues:** If a discharge issue initially prevents eligibility, the 12-year delimiting period does NOT begin until after the character of discharge is upgraded or VA determines it no longer bars benefits (38 CFR 21.42(b)). This means the clock does not run against you while you resolve discharge issues.

#### Requirement 2 -- Service-Connected Disability Rating

You need EITHER:
- A service-connected disability rating of **10% or higher** AND a finding of **Serious Employment Handicap (SEH)**, OR
- A service-connected disability rating of **20% or higher** AND a finding of **Employment Handicap (EH)**

This is a critical threshold. At 10-19%, the bar is higher -- you must demonstrate a SERIOUS employment handicap, not merely an employment handicap. At 20% and above, the standard employment handicap finding is sufficient.

**Pending ratings:** If you have filed a VA disability claim that has not yet been decided, you may still apply for VR&E. The VA can process your VR&E application once a rating is established.

### Active Duty Service Member Eligibility

You do NOT have to be separated from the military to apply. Active duty service members qualify if ANY of the following apply:

- You have a **20% or higher pre-discharge disability rating** (memorandum rating) and will soon leave the military
- You are **waiting to be discharged** due to a severe illness or injury that occurred on active duty
- You are participating in the **Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES)** process
- You are a **severely injured active-duty service member** -- in this case, you can automatically receive VR&E benefits BEFORE VA even issues a disability rating

Your military Transition Coordinator can refer you directly to VR&E. You do not have to wait for separation.

---

## 3. EMPLOYMENT HANDICAP VS. SERIOUS EMPLOYMENT HANDICAP

This is the MOST IMPORTANT determination the VRC will make at your appointment. Understanding the difference and how to demonstrate each is critical.

### Employment Handicap (EH) -- 38 CFR 21.51

**Definition:** An impairment of your ability to prepare for, obtain, or retain employment consistent with your abilities, aptitudes, and interests.

**Three conditions must be met:**
1. The veteran has an impairment of employability (documented barriers to suitable work)
2. The veteran's service-connected disability contributes to the impairment in an identifiable, measurable, or observable way
3. The veteran has not overcome the impairment through current suitable employment

**Required for:** Veterans rated 20% or higher to receive VR&E services.

### Serious Employment Handicap (SEH) -- 38 CFR 21.52

**Definition:** A SIGNIFICANT impairment of your ability to prepare for, obtain, or retain employment consistent with your abilities, aptitudes, and interests.

**Three conditions must ALL be met:**
1. **Significant vocational impairment** -- your ability to prepare for, obtain, or keep suitable work is SIGNIFICANTLY impaired (not just impaired, but significantly so)
2. **Effects not overcome** -- you have NOT already overcome this impairment through current employment or qualifying for suitable work (including situations where you lost suitable work through no fault of your own)
3. **Service-connected disability contribution** -- your SC disabilities must have an "identifiable, measurable, or observable causative effect" on the overall impairment. They do NOT have to be the sole cause or even the primary cause.

**Required for:** Veterans rated 10-19% to receive VR&E services. Also required for any veteran to receive extensions beyond the 12-year delimiting date or the 48-month entitlement limit.

### Factors the VRC Evaluates for SEH (38 CFR 21.52(b))

The VRC will assess ALL of the following when determining whether you have an SEH:

1. **Number of disabling conditions** -- more conditions = stronger case
2. **Severity of conditions** -- higher ratings and more functional limitations = stronger case
3. **Whether a neuropsychiatric condition exists** -- PTSD, depression, anxiety, TBI, etc.
4. **Adequacy of education and training** -- do you have the credentials for suitable work?
5. **Periods of unemployment or underemployment** -- gaps in employment history, inability to hold jobs
6. **History of reliance on government support programs** -- disability compensation, unemployment benefits, food assistance, etc.
7. **Complexity of services needed and extent of assistance required** -- do you need extensive retraining?
8. **Discrimination, labor market barriers, substance abuse** -- any additional barriers to employment
9. **Any other employment-related factors** -- this is a catch-all

### Key Thresholds and Presumptions

| SC Rating | SEH Determination |
|---|---|
| 50%+ | Strong presumption toward SEH finding |
| 30%+ neuropsychiatric condition | SEH is typically found AUTOMATICALLY (38 CFR 21.52(c)) |
| 30-40% with complicating factors | SEH may be found -- poor adjustment history, non-SC disabilities adding complexity, family pressures requiring multiple support services (38 CFR 21.52(d)) |
| Below 30% with documented patterns | SEH can STILL be found if there are documented periods of unemployment, unstable work history, or maladaptive behavior caused by SC disability (38 CFR 21.52(e)) |

### Practical Meaning

- **EH** gets you into the program at 20%+
- **SEH** gets you into the program at 10%+, AND it unlocks two major benefits regardless of rating:
  1. The 12-year delimiting date can be waived entirely
  2. The 48-month entitlement limit can be extended beyond 48 months

---

## 4. THE 12-YEAR DELIMITING DATE

### When the Clock Starts

The 12-year basic period of eligibility runs from whichever is LATER:
- The date you received notice of your separation from active military service, OR
- The date you first received notification of a VA service-connected disability rating

**Example:** You separated in 2010 but did not receive your first SC rating until 2015. Your 12-year clock started in 2015, not 2010. Your eligibility would run until 2027.

### THE MAJOR EXCEPTION -- January 1, 2013 Rule

**If you were discharged on or after January 1, 2013, the 12-year time limit DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU.**

This was enacted through the VOW to Hire Heroes Act of 2011 (P.L. 112-56) and subsequent VA rulemaking. If your separation date is January 1, 2013 or later, there is NO time limit on your VR&E eligibility. You can skip the rest of this section.

### ALL Exceptions to the 12-Year Limit (for pre-January 2013 separations)

For veterans who separated BEFORE January 1, 2013, the following exceptions can extend or toll the 12-year period:

#### Exception 1 -- Qualifying Rating Not Yet Established (38 CFR 21.42(a))

The clock does NOT start until you receive notification of a qualifying disability rating (20%+ or 10% with SEH). If you were discharged in 2005 but didn't receive your 20% rating until 2012, your 12-year period runs from 2012 to 2024, not from 2005.

#### Exception 2 -- Character of Discharge Bar (38 CFR 21.42(b))

If a discharge characterization initially prevented eligibility, the 12-year period begins ONLY after:
- The discharge is upgraded, OR
- VA determines the discharge character no longer bars benefits

The clock starts from the date of the discharge change or VA determination, not from the original separation date.

#### Exception 3 -- Medical or Mental Condition Tolling (38 CFR 21.42(c))

The 12-year clock STOPS RUNNING during any period when a veteran cannot participate in VR&E due to medical or mental conditions lasting 30 or more consecutive days. This includes:
- Service-connected conditions
- Non-service-connected conditions
- Chronic alcoholism
- Any hospitalization or treatment that would prevent participation

**Example:** Your 12-year period was set to expire in 2020, but you were hospitalized for 6 months in 2018 due to a mental health crisis. Those 6 months are added to your eligibility period, extending it to mid-2020.

#### Exception 4 -- Serious Employment Handicap (38 CFR 21.52)

This is the broadest exception. If a VRC finds you have a Serious Employment Handicap, the 12-year limit can be COMPLETELY WAIVED. The VRC can extend eligibility for whatever additional period is needed to accomplish your rehabilitation program. There is no outer limit.

This is one of the most important reasons to pursue an SEH finding even if you already qualify under EH.

#### Exception 5 -- Previously Rehabilitated Veterans (38 CFR 21.44)

If you completed a previous VR&E program but need to return because:
- Your SC disability worsened, preventing performance of your trained occupation
- Your previous occupation is no longer suitable given current disabilities
- Occupational requirements changed, requiring additional training
- You have not yet achieved actual employability

The basic period can be extended to allow for a new rehabilitation program.

### Critical Procedural Point

A VRC denial based SOLELY on the 12-year time limit -- without analyzing ALL applicable exceptions and calculating from the correct triggering date -- may be procedurally improper and is appealable. If you are denied on this basis, ask the VRC to document which exceptions were considered and why each was found inapplicable.

---

## 5. THE INITIAL APPOINTMENT -- WHAT TO EXPECT

The initial appointment is the most important step in the entire VR&E process. The outcome of most VR&E cases hinges on this meeting. A well-prepared approach sets the stage for approval, while common mistakes can lead to denials that are hard to overturn.

### The Process Has Two Parts

#### Part 1 -- Orientation (Group or Individual Session)

- Usually a group video presentation or slideshow explaining the VR&E program
- Covers the five service tracks (see Section 9)
- Overview of benefits, subsistence allowance, expectations, and responsibilities
- General information about program rules and requirements
- Sometimes held the same day as your evaluation, sometimes scheduled separately
- Duration: approximately 30-60 minutes

**At orientation, take notes.** Pay attention to what the VA expects from participants (attendance requirements, progress standards, communication expectations). Understanding the rules up front prevents problems later.

#### Part 2 -- Initial Evaluation (Individual Meeting with VRC)

This is the CRITICAL one-on-one meeting where your entitlement is determined. The Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) will:

1. **Review your service history and discharge** -- confirming basic eligibility
2. **Review your VA disability rating** -- examining each rated condition and its severity
3. **Review your medical records** -- the VRC has access to your VA medical records but may not have reviewed them in detail before the meeting
4. **Discuss your employment history** -- jobs held, duration, reasons for leaving, problems encountered
5. **Discuss your education and training** -- degrees, certifications, military training, skills
6. **Discuss your career goals** -- what you want to do and why
7. **Assess your interests, aptitudes, and abilities** -- through conversation and formal assessment tools
8. **Evaluate the employment handicap** -- how your SC disabilities specifically create barriers to suitable employment
9. **Make the EH/SEH determination** -- this may happen at the meeting or may require additional information/appointments
10. **Determine feasibility of a vocational goal** -- whether it is "reasonably feasible" for you to achieve your stated goal

### Duration

The initial evaluation itself typically runs 60-90 minutes. Combined with orientation, expect to be at the VA office for 2-4 hours on your appointment day. Some offices schedule orientation and evaluation on different days.

### Timeline from Application to Plan Approval

| Stage | Typical Timeline |
|---|---|
| Application processing | 2-6 weeks |
| Wait for first appointment | 2-8 weeks (varies heavily by regional office backlog) |
| Orientation + Initial Evaluation | 1 day (or 2 separate appointments) |
| Entitlement determination | Same day to several weeks (may require additional appointments) |
| Extended Evaluation (if ordered) | Up to 12 months |
| Rehabilitation plan development | 1-3 additional meetings after entitlement |
| Total from application to training start | Commonly 2-6 months, can be longer |

### The "Reasonable Doubt" Standard

By regulation, **any reasonable doubt shall be resolved in favor of a finding of feasibility.** This means if the VRC is on the fence about whether your vocational goal is achievable, the law says they MUST resolve doubt in your favor. This is codified at 38 CFR 21.53(d). If a VRC denies feasibility, ask them to document how they applied the reasonable doubt standard.

---

## 6. DOCUMENTS TO BRING TOMORROW

Bring ALL of the following. Organize them in a folder or binder. Being prepared demonstrates commitment and makes the VRC's job easier.

### Essential Documents

1. **DD-214** (Member 4 copy preferred) -- proof of service and discharge status
2. **VA disability rating decision letter** -- the most current letter showing your combined rating percentage and each individually rated condition. If you have had rating increases, bring the most recent decision.
3. **Current resume** -- even a rough one. If you don't have one, write a simple chronological list of employment with dates, positions, duties, and reasons for leaving.
4. **Educational transcripts** -- all colleges, trade schools, community colleges. Include military training records (JST/Joint Services Transcript, CCAF transcript, Army/Navy/Marine/Air Force/Coast Guard training certificates). If you cannot obtain transcripts before tomorrow, write down the schools, dates, and what you studied.
5. **Employment history** -- dates of employment, positions held, employers, duties, and critically: reasons for leaving each job, especially if you left due to disability-related issues.

### Strongly Recommended Documents

6. **Medical records related to SC conditions** -- the VRC has access to VA records but having your own copies shows preparation and ensures nothing is missed. Include any private medical records for SC conditions.
7. **Letters from doctors, therapists, or providers** -- especially anything that describes how your conditions affect your ability to work. A letter from your psychiatrist saying "Patient's PTSD causes difficulty concentrating in workplace environments and interacting with coworkers" is powerful supporting evidence.
8. **Job certifications or professional licenses** -- anything you currently hold
9. **Documentation of failed employment attempts** -- termination letters, performance reviews showing disability-related issues, records of accommodations requested, documentation of workplace problems tied to your SC conditions
10. **Written career goals** -- even bullet points showing you have thought about what you want to do and why. Include WHY this particular career accommodates your disabilities.

### Additional Supporting Items

11. **Records of government assistance** -- if you have relied on unemployment benefits, SNAP, VA disability compensation as primary income, disability-related housing assistance, etc., this supports an SEH finding
12. **VA treatment records showing employment barriers** -- therapy notes where you discussed work difficulties, vocational assessments, any VA provider's recommendation for vocational rehabilitation
13. **Proof of any vocational testing** -- CareerScope results, O*NET Interest Profiler results, any assessments from previous job training programs

---

## 7. THE VRC ASSESSMENT PROCESS

### Formal Assessment Tools the VRC May Use

#### Rehabilitation Needs Inventory (RNI) -- VA Form 28-1902w
- A comprehensive questionnaire covering personal information, employment history, education, disability impacts, and rehabilitation needs
- Takes approximately 45 minutes to complete
- May be completed at the appointment or mailed to you beforehand
- Fill this out thoroughly and honestly -- do NOT minimize your limitations

#### CareerScope Assessment
- An online aptitude and interest assessment tool
- Measures career interests across multiple domains
- Tests aptitudes in areas like verbal reasoning, numerical ability, spatial perception, etc.
- May be administered before the appointment (you might receive a link via email) or at the appointment itself
- Takes approximately 30-60 minutes
- Answer honestly based on what interests you and what you can actually do with your disabilities

#### Other Assessment Tools the VRC May Use
- **COPES** (Career Orientation Placement and Evaluation Survey) -- values assessment
- **O*NET Interest Profiler** -- career interest inventory matching you to occupational categories
- **Transferable Skills Analysis** -- what skills from military/civilian experience transfer to new careers
- **Labor Market Analysis** -- evaluating whether your career goal has viable employment opportunities in your geographic area

### What the VRC is Looking For

The VRC must answer these specific questions:

1. **Does the veteran have an Employment Handicap?**
   - Is there an impairment to the veteran's ability to prepare for, obtain, or retain suitable employment?
   - Does the service-connected disability contribute to this impairment?
   - Has the veteran already overcome this impairment?

2. **Does the veteran have a Serious Employment Handicap?**
   - Is the impairment SIGNIFICANT?
   - Do the factors in 38 CFR 21.52(b) support a finding of significance?

3. **Is a vocational goal reasonably feasible?**
   - Can the veteran realistically achieve the stated career goal?
   - Is the goal consistent with the veteran's abilities, aptitudes, and interests?
   - Does the goal lead to suitable employment that won't aggravate disabilities?
   - Remember: reasonable doubt is resolved IN FAVOR of feasibility

4. **Which service track is appropriate?**
   - Does the veteran need long-term training, or are they already employable?

### Extended Evaluation

If the VRC cannot determine feasibility at the initial meeting, they may place you in an **Extended Evaluation** for up to 12 months. This is NOT a denial. It means the VRC needs more information -- possibly college coursework, work experience, or additional medical evaluation -- before making a final determination.

During Extended Evaluation:
- You receive the subsistence allowance
- You may take classes or participate in activities to demonstrate feasibility
- The VRC monitors your progress
- At the end, the VRC makes a final determination on feasibility and develops your plan

---

## 8. WHAT TO SAY AND WHAT NOT TO SAY

### DO -- Say These Things

**Connect every SC disability to specific employment barriers:**
- GOOD: "My lumbar spine condition prevents me from sitting for more than 30 minutes at a time, which eliminates the office jobs I was trained for in the military. Standing jobs aggravate my knee condition. I need retraining for a career that allows position changes and flexible work arrangements."
- BAD: "My back hurts."

**Be specific about your career goal:**
- GOOD: "I want to complete a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology with a focus on cybersecurity. This career allows remote work options, which accommodates my PTSD triggers in crowded environments, and the analytical nature of the work aligns with my aptitudes from military intelligence training."
- BAD: "I want to go to school." or "I don't know what I want to do."

**Describe your worst days honestly:**
- The VRC needs to understand the FULL impact of your disabilities
- If there are days you cannot get out of bed, say so
- If you have panic attacks that would prevent you from functioning in a workplace, describe what happens
- If pain prevents you from concentrating, explain the severity and frequency
- This is NOT the time to put on a brave face

**Document failed employment:**
- "I was fired from my warehouse job after 3 months because I could not meet the physical requirements due to my shoulder injury."
- "I left my customer service position because my PTSD made it impossible to handle confrontational callers without severe anxiety episodes."
- "I have not been able to hold a job for more than 6 months since separation because of the combined effects of my conditions."

**Mention patterns:**
- Unemployment periods
- Underemployment (working below your skill level because disabilities prevent suitable work)
- Reliance on VA compensation or other government assistance as primary income
- Social isolation, difficulty with workplace relationships
- Need for frequent medical appointments that interfere with work schedules

### DO NOT -- Avoid These Mistakes

**Do NOT say "I just want to use my GI Bill":**
VR&E is a rehabilitation program, not an education benefit. If the VRC thinks you just want free school without genuine employment barriers, they may deny entitlement. Frame everything in terms of rehabilitation and overcoming employment handicaps.

**Do NOT be vague about your goals:**
The VRC needs to evaluate feasibility of a specific goal. Walking in with no idea what you want to do makes their job harder and may result in a less favorable outcome or an Extended Evaluation when you could have received immediate entitlement.

**Do NOT downplay your disabilities:**
Many veterans instinctively minimize their conditions. "I'm fine, I just need some help getting started" can be interpreted as NOT having an employment handicap. Be honest about your limitations. The VRC is evaluating whether your disabilities create a substantial barrier to employment. If you say you're fine, they may agree.

**Do NOT be combative or adversarial:**
The VRC is supposed to be your ally. Coming in with a chip on your shoulder or treating the meeting as a confrontation undermines the collaborative relationship needed for a successful program. Be respectful, prepared, and clear.

**Do NOT miss the appointment:**
If you miss the initial appointment without rescheduling in advance, it creates a negative record. If an emergency prevents attendance, call the VR&E office as early as possible and reschedule.

**Do NOT lie or exaggerate:**
Be honest about your limitations. Exaggeration can be detected through medical records review and will destroy your credibility. Your actual limitations, described accurately and specifically, are almost certainly sufficient.

**Do NOT say your disabilities don't affect your work (if they actually do):**
Some veterans who work despite their disabilities say "Oh, I manage fine at work" and then wonder why they're denied. If you are working but struggling, explain the struggle. If you can work but only in a limited capacity, explain the limitations. If you could work more or at a higher level but for your disabilities, explain that.

---

## 9. THE FIVE SERVICE TRACKS

After entitlement is determined, you will be placed on one of five tracks. Understanding these before your appointment helps you have an informed conversation with the VRC about which track fits your situation.

### Track 1 -- Reemployment

**What it is:** Assistance returning to your previous employer or a similar position.

**Who it's for:** Veterans who were previously employed and can return to that type of work with accommodations or assistance.

**What VR&E provides:** Help with workplace accommodations, assistive technology, job retention support, employer negotiation for modified duties.

### Track 2 -- Rapid Access to Employment

**What it is:** Accelerated job placement for veterans who already have marketable skills.

**Who it's for:** Veterans who have transferable skills and don't need retraining, but need help finding and securing employment.

**What VR&E provides:** Resume development, interview coaching, job search assistance, networking support, short-term certification courses (if needed to update existing skills).

### Track 3 -- Employment Through Long-Term Services

**What it is:** Comprehensive retraining for a new career. THIS IS THE TRACK MOST VETERANS ARE SEEKING.

**Who it's for:** Veterans who need education, training, or certification in a new field because their disabilities prevent them from working in their previous occupation.

**What VR&E provides:**
- Full tuition and fees at approved schools (including 4-year universities, community colleges, trade schools, certification programs)
- Books, supplies, and equipment
- Monthly subsistence allowance
- Tutoring and academic support
- Assistive technology
- Internship or on-the-job training placement
- Job placement after completing training

**Duration:** Up to 48 months of full-time equivalent services (extendable with SEH finding).

### Track 4 -- Self-Employment

**What it is:** Support for starting your own business.

**Who it's for:** Veterans whose disabilities make traditional employment settings difficult, or who have viable business ideas and the skills to execute them.

**What VR&E provides:** Help developing a business plan, possible funding for startup costs and equipment, analysis of the business concept's viability, mentorship connections.

### Track 5 -- Independent Living

**What it is:** Services to improve your ability to live independently.

**Who it's for:** Veterans whose disabilities are so severe that employment is not currently feasible, but who can improve their daily functioning with assistance.

**What VR&E provides:** Assistive technology for the home, home modifications, connections to community services, daily living skills training, volunteer opportunities.

**Note:** Independent Living is meant to be a stepping stone. The VA periodically reevaluates whether a vocational goal becomes feasible.

---

## 10. ENTITLEMENT -- THE 48 MONTHS AND BEYOND

### Basic Entitlement

VR&E provides up to **48 months of full-time equivalent services** under Chapter 31. This covers:
- Tuition and fees (paid directly to the school -- no out-of-pocket cost)
- Books, supplies, and required equipment
- Monthly subsistence allowance (see Section 12)
- Travel assistance to and from training (in some cases)

### Part-Time Equivalency

If you attend part-time, the 48 months extends proportionally:
- Full-time = 1 month of entitlement used per month
- 3/4 time = 0.75 months used per month (64 calendar months to exhaust)
- 1/2 time = 0.5 months used per month (96 calendar months to exhaust)

### Can the 48 Months Be Extended?

**YES, under specific circumstances:**

1. **Serious Employment Handicap (SEH):** If you have an SEH finding, the 48-month limit can be extended as needed to complete your rehabilitation plan. There is no hard cap when SEH applies. The extension must be approved by the VRC and documented as necessary for your vocational rehabilitation.

2. **Slow Progress Due to Disability:** If your SC conditions cause you to need more time (e.g., reduced course load due to medical appointments, disability flare-ups causing missed semesters), extensions may be approved.

3. **Program Change:** If your original vocational goal is determined to be infeasible midway through and you must retrain for a different goal, additional months may be authorized.

### What Happens After Completing Training?

After you complete your training program and achieve your vocational goal, VR&E provides:
- **Job placement assistance** -- the VRC helps you find employment in your trained field
- **Post-employment services** -- up to 18 months of follow-up support to help you maintain employment

---

## 11. VR&E AND GI BILL INTERACTION

This section is critical for financial planning. The rules changed significantly in April 2021.

### The April 2021 Rule Change (48-Month Combined Cap)

**BEFORE April 1, 2021:**
VR&E (Chapter 31) months counted against the combined 48-month cap for ALL VA education programs. Using 36 months of GI Bill and then applying for VR&E would leave only 12 months of VR&E available.

**AFTER April 1, 2021:**
VR&E (Chapter 31) NO LONGER COUNTS against the 48-month combined cap for other VA education benefit programs (Post-9/11 GI Bill, Montgomery GI Bill, etc.).

### The Direction Matters -- THIS IS CRITICAL

The April 2021 change is NOT reciprocal. The direction in which you use the benefits matters:

| Order of Use | Effect |
|---|---|
| VR&E FIRST, then GI Bill | VR&E months are NOT deducted from your GI Bill entitlement. You could use up to 48 months of VR&E + 36 months of Post-9/11 GI Bill = 84 total months. |
| GI Bill FIRST, then VR&E | GI Bill months STILL count against your VR&E entitlement. If you used 36 months of GI Bill, you would only have 12 months of VR&E available (unless extended by SEH). |

**THE OPTIMAL STRATEGY IN MOST CASES: Use VR&E FIRST, then GI Bill second.**

### Using VR&E After Exhausting GI Bill

YES, you CAN apply for and use VR&E after exhausting your Post-9/11 GI Bill, provided you meet the eligibility requirements. However:

- You will receive the **Chapter 31 subsistence allowance rate**, NOT the Post-9/11 GI Bill BAH rate
- The subsistence allowance is often SIGNIFICANTLY lower than BAH in most areas
- Under the 48-month combined cap rules (prior to the April 2021 change), you would get an additional 12 months (48 total minus 36 used). Under the new rules, VR&E months are separate, so you could potentially receive up to 48 months of VR&E.

### Subsistence Allowance vs. BAH Rate -- The Election

If you still have REMAINING Post-9/11 GI Bill entitlement when you start VR&E, you may be able to **elect** to receive the Post-9/11 GI Bill BAH rate instead of the lower Chapter 31 subsistence allowance. This is called the "Chapter 33 rate" or "co-enrollment."

**Key points about the election:**
- You must have remaining Post-9/11 GI Bill entitlement
- Electing the Chapter 33 rate WILL consume your remaining GI Bill entitlement
- This only applies to the subsistence/BAH payment -- tuition and fees are still paid by VR&E
- Discuss this option with your VRC at the appointment

### Quick Summary Table

| Scenario | Monthly Payment | GI Bill Impact |

## 13. APPLICATION PROCESS -- VA FORM 28-1900

### Three Ways to Apply

#### Option 1 -- Online (Recommended)

Apply directly through VA.gov:
**URL:** https://www.va.gov/careers-employment/vocational-rehabilitation/apply-vre-form-28-1900/

You can complete the entire VA Form 28-1900 electronically. This is the fastest method and creates an immediate record.

#### Option 2 -- By Mail

Download VA Form 28-1900 from:
**URL:** https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/vba-28-1900-are.pdf

Complete the form and mail it to your closest VA Regional Office. Find your regional office at: https://www.va.gov/find-locations/

#### Option 3 -- In Person

Visit your VA Regional Office and a VA employee can help you complete the form. Use the VA facility locator: https://www.va.gov/find-locations/

### What Happens After You Apply

1. **VA confirms receipt** and verifies basic eligibility (SC rating + discharge status)
2. If eligible, VA determines you are **eligible** (basic requirements met)
3. VA schedules you for **orientation** (sometimes included in the appointment letter)
4. You attend orientation and then the **initial evaluation** with a VRC
5. The VRC determines if you are **entitled** (EH or SEH finding)
6. If entitled, you and the VRC develop your **Individualized Written Rehabilitation Plan (IWRP)**
7. Services begin according to the plan

### What Triggers the Orientation Requirement

Every applicant who passes the initial eligibility screening (SC disability + qualifying discharge) is scheduled for orientation. This is automatic and mandatory. The orientation appointment letter is typically your confirmation that you passed the initial screening.

Orientation does NOT mean entitlement. It means you are eligible to be evaluated for entitlement.

---

## 14. IF YOU ARE DENIED -- APPEAL OPTIONS

If the VRC determines you do NOT have an Employment Handicap, or denies your claim for any other reason, you have three appeal options. ALL must be filed within ONE YEAR of the denial decision.

### Option 1 -- Higher-Level Review (HLR)

**Form:** VA Form 20-0996
**What it is:** A senior VR&E officer (or VRC supervisor) at your Regional Office reviews the original decision de novo (fresh look, not bound by the original VRC's findings).
**Key limitation:** You CANNOT submit new evidence with an HLR. The reviewer looks only at the evidence that was in the record when the original decision was made.
**Best for:** Cases where you believe the VRC misapplied the regulations or ignored evidence already in the record.

### Option 2 -- Supplemental Claim

**Form:** VA Form 20-0995
**What it is:** You submit new and relevant evidence that was not in the record at the time of the original decision, and the VA re-evaluates.
**Timeline:** VA has 125 days to review and issue a decision.
**Best for:** Cases where you have additional evidence that supports your claim -- new medical documentation, letters from providers, documentation of employment failures, new disability ratings, vocational assessments.

**Examples of strong supplemental evidence:**
- Letters from doctors/therapists describing employment limitations caused by SC conditions
- Documentation of job applications, rejections, or terminations related to disability
- New or increased disability ratings from the VA
- Vocational expert opinions
- Labor market analyses showing limited employment options given your disabilities

### Option 3 -- Board of Veterans Appeals (BVA)

**Form:** VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement)
**What it is:** An appeal to the Board of Veterans Appeals in Washington, D.C. for an independent review by a Veterans Law Judge.
**Timeline:** Longer process -- can take months to years depending on the docket.
**Options:** Direct review (no new evidence, no hearing), evidence submission (new evidence allowed), or hearing (present your case to a judge via video or in person).
**Best for:** Cases where you believe the Regional Office decision was fundamentally wrong and lower-level review won't fix it.

### What to Cite in Any Appeal

When appealing an EH/SEH denial, directly reference:
- **38 CFR 21.51** -- definition of Employment Handicap and factors to consider
- **38 CFR 21.52** -- definition of Serious Employment Handicap, assessment factors, and thresholds
- **38 CFR 21.53(d)** -- the reasonable doubt standard for feasibility determinations
- **38 CFR 21.50** -- specific factors the VRC must evaluate

Address the specific reasons cited in your denial letter. The VRC is required to explain WHY they found no EH/SEH. Your appeal should directly rebut each stated reason with evidence and regulatory citations.

### Consider Legal Representation

Organizations that provide free representation for VR&E appeals:
- **Disabled American Veterans (DAV)** -- free claims and appeals representation
- **Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW)** -- free claims assistance
- **American Legion** -- free claims assistance
- **National Veterans Legal Services Program (NVLSP)** -- legal representation
- **State-based veteran legal clinics** -- many law schools operate free clinics for veterans
- **Accredited Veterans Service Officers (VSOs)** at your county or state level

Private attorneys who specialize in VR&E appeals may also be an option. Under VA rules, attorney fees for initial claims are limited, but for appeals, attorneys can typically charge up to 20% of past-due benefits or a reasonable fee.
