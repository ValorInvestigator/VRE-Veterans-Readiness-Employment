# COMPLETE SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS

---

## 1. GENERAL PROVISIONS AND OVERVIEW (21.1)

### Section 21.1 -- Training and rehabilitation for veterans with service-connected disabilities

This section establishes the statutory and regulatory foundation for the entire VR&E program. The VA will provide training, rehabilitation, and employment services to veterans with service-connected disabilities under Chapter 31 of Title 38, United States Code.

**The four program goals are:**

1. **Evaluate and improve** a veteran's ability to achieve a vocational goal
2. **Provide services** needed to qualify for suitable employment
3. **Enable maximum independence** in daily living
4. **Enable the veteran to obtain and maintain** suitable employment

**Key principle:** The program is designed to serve BOTH veterans who can work (vocational rehabilitation leading to employment) AND veterans whose disabilities are so severe that work is not currently feasible (independent living track). The program is not employment-only.

---

## 2. NONDUPLICATION (21.21-21.22)

### Section 21.21 -- Election of benefits under education programs administered by VA

Veterans must elect which education benefit to receive if eligible for multiple VA programs. A veteran CANNOT receive Chapter 31 benefits concurrently with other VA education benefits (such as Chapter 33 Post-9/11 GI Bill, Chapter 30 Montgomery GI Bill, etc.) for the same period of training.

**However:** A veteran CAN elect to receive the Chapter 33 (Post-9/11) subsistence allowance rate INSTEAD of the standard Chapter 31 subsistence rate while still being in the Chapter 31 program. This is a critical distinction -- you stay in Chapter 31 for program purposes but get the higher Post-9/11 housing allowance rate. See Section 21.264 for details.

**Important:** Using Chapter 31 does NOT consume your Chapter 33 entitlement months (unless you elect the Post-9/11 rate, in which case both entitlements are charged).

### Section 21.22 -- Nonduplication -- Federal programs

VR&E benefits may not be duplicated with other federal training programs (e.g., Department of Labor programs, state vocational rehabilitation). However, VA may coordinate with these other programs to provide complementary services.

---

## 3. CLAIMS (21.30-21.33)

### Section 21.30 -- Claims

Application for VR&E benefits is initiated by filing **VA Form 28-1900** (Disabled Veterans Application for Vocational Rehabilitation). This can be filed:
- Online through VA.gov
- In person at a VA Regional Office
- By mail to the VA Regional Office with jurisdiction
- Through an accredited Veterans Service Organization (VSO)

**Filing tip:** You can apply as soon as you receive a service-connected disability rating of at least 10%. You do NOT need to wait for a 20% rating -- a 10% rating qualifies if you have a serious employment handicap.

### Section 21.31 -- Informal claim

Any communication from a claimant, or authorized representative, indicating an intent to apply for VR&E benefits may be considered an **informal claim**. This includes:
- Phone calls to the VA
- Written correspondence
- Statements made during other VA interactions
- Electronic communications

**Why this matters:** The date of the informal claim can establish the effective date of benefits. If you called VA expressing interest in VR&E before formally filing, that call date may protect your entitlement start date.

### Section 21.32 -- Notification by VA of necessary information or evidence

When a claim is filed, VA will:
1. Notify the claimant of any information or evidence needed to substantiate the claim
2. Specify what portion of the evidence VA will obtain and what portion the claimant must provide
3. Provide a reasonable time for the claimant to respond

**Your right:** VA cannot deny a claim for insufficient evidence without first notifying you of what evidence is needed and giving you time to provide it.

### Section 21.33 -- VA duty to assist claimants in obtaining evidence

VA has an affirmative obligation to assist claimants in obtaining evidence needed to process claims, including:
- Obtaining relevant records from federal agencies
- Making reasonable efforts to obtain relevant records from non-federal sources
- Providing a medical examination or obtaining a medical opinion when necessary

**Key protection:** This "duty to assist" means VA cannot simply deny your claim because records are missing. They must make reasonable efforts to help you gather evidence.

---

## 4. DEFINITIONS (21.35) -- CRITICAL SECTION

### Section 21.35 -- Definitions

These definitions control the entire VR&E program. Understanding them is essential for your appointment.

**Vocational Goal:** A gainful employment status consistent with the veteran's abilities, aptitudes, and interests. "Gainful employment" means employment that provides an income at least at the federal poverty level for a single person, or at the minimum wage level, whichever is higher.

**Employment Handicap:** An impairment of a veteran's ability to prepare for, obtain, or retain employment consistent with the veteran's abilities, aptitudes, and interests. An employment handicap exists when:
- The veteran has a vocational impairment (impaired ability to prepare for, obtain, or keep employment consistent with abilities, aptitudes, and interests), AND
- The veteran has NOT overcome the effects of the impairment through current employment in a suitable occupation

**Serious Employment Handicap (SEH):** A SIGNIFICANT impairment of a veteran's ability to prepare for, obtain, or retain employment consistent with the veteran's abilities, aptitudes, and interests. This is a higher threshold than a regular employment handicap. The word "significant" is the differentiator. Factors considered include:
- Severity and duration of the service-connected disability
- Presence of nonservice-connected disabilities that compound the effect
- Educational deficiencies
- Extended periods of unemployment
- Prior unsuccessful rehabilitation attempts
- Vocational and social maladjustment

**Why the distinction matters:**
- 20% or higher rating: Only need to show an EMPLOYMENT HANDICAP
- 10% rating: Must show a SERIOUS EMPLOYMENT HANDICAP (higher bar)
- The distinction also affects eligibility for extensions beyond the basic period

**Reasonable Feasibility (of achieving a vocational goal):** The effects of the veteran's disability (service and nonservice-connected), when considered in relation to the veteran's circumstances, do NOT prevent the veteran from successfully pursuing a vocational rehabilitation program and becoming gainfully employed in an occupation consistent with the veteran's abilities, aptitudes, and interests.

**Not Currently Reasonably Feasible:** The effects of the veteran's disability either:
1. Prevent the veteran from successfully achieving a vocational goal at that time, OR
2. Are expected to worsen within the period needed to achieve a vocational goal

This finding triggers eligibility for the Independent Living track.

**Rehabilitation Facility:** A distinct organizational entity which provides goal-oriented, comprehensive, and coordinated services designed to evaluate and minimize the handicapping effects of physical, mental, social, and vocational disadvantages. Includes VA medical centers, community rehabilitation programs, state vocational rehabilitation agencies, and private rehabilitation providers.

**Independence in Daily Living:** The ability of a veteran, without the services of others or with a reduced level of the services of others, to live and function within the veteran's family and community. This is the goal of the Independent Living track.

**Suitable Employment:** Employment that:
1. Does NOT worsen the veteran's disability
2. Is stable (not temporary or marginal)
3. Is consistent with the veteran's abilities, aptitudes, and interests
4. Provides an income adequate for basic needs

**Program of Rehabilitation Services:** The totality of services authorized under Chapter 31, including evaluation, counseling, training, employment assistance, independent living services, subsistence allowance, and all supportive services.

**Plan:** Refers collectively to the four types of individualized plans:
- IWRP (Individualized Written Rehabilitation Plan)
- IEEP (Individualized Extended Evaluation Plan)
- IEAP (Individualized Employment Assistance Plan)
- IILP (Individualized Independent Living Plan)

**Counseling Psychologist (CP):** A VA employee qualified to provide professional counseling and assessment services. Has authority to make entitlement and feasibility determinations.

**Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC):** A VA employee who serves as the veteran's primary point of contact throughout the rehabilitation process. Has authority to make entitlement and feasibility determinations. This is the person you will meet with at your appointment.

**Case Manager:** The VRC or other VR&E staff member assigned to manage the veteran's rehabilitation program on a day-to-day basis.

**Rate of Pursuit:** The fraction of full-time training in which a veteran is engaged (full-time, three-quarter time, half-time, quarter-time). Determines subsistence allowance rate.

**Rehabilitation to the Point of Employability:** The provision of services to enable a veteran to achieve a vocational goal, including education, training, and any supportive services necessary.

**Employment Services:** Job placement, job development, post-employment support, and related services provided after a veteran achieves rehabilitation to the point of employability.

---

## 5. ENTITLEMENT (21.40) -- CRITICAL SECTION

### Section 21.40 -- Basic entitlement to vocational rehabilitation benefits and services

A veteran meets basic entitlement if VA determines they satisfy ANY ONE of these four criteria:

### (a) Veterans rated 20% or more:
ALL of the following must be true:
1. The veteran has a service-connected disability or combination of disabilities rated **20 percent or more** under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 11
2. The disability was incurred or aggravated in active military, naval, air, or space service on or after **September 16, 1940**
3. VA determines the veteran is in need of rehabilitation because of an **employment handicap**

### (b) Veterans rated 10%:
ALL of the following must be true:
1. The veteran has a service-connected disability rated at least **10 percent** under Chapter 11
2. The disability was incurred or aggravated in active service on or after September 16, 1940
3. VA determines the veteran is in need of rehabilitation to overcome a **serious employment handicap**

### (c) Servicemembers awaiting discharge:
ALL of the following must be true:
1. The individual is a servicemember who, while awaiting discharge, is hospitalized or receiving outpatient care for a disability
2. VA determines the disability will likely be service-connected
3. The disability will likely be rated at least **10 percent** compensable
4. The individual is in need of rehabilitation because of an employment handicap
5. The hospital or medical facility is operating under appropriate authority

### (d) Servicemembers with memorandum ratings:
1. The servicemember has a pre-discharge memorandum disability rating of **20 percent or more**
2. The servicemember is imminently separating from active service
3. This allows early entry into VR&E through the Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES)

### CRITICAL DISTINCTION TABLE:

| Disability Rating | Required Finding | Standard |
|-------------------|-----------------|----------|
| 20% or higher | Employment Handicap | Lower bar -- impairment of ability to get/keep work |
| 10% exactly | Serious Employment Handicap | Higher bar -- SIGNIFICANT impairment |
| Pre-discharge 10%+ | Employment Handicap | Same as 20%+ while still in service |
| Pre-discharge 20%+ (memo) | Employment Handicap | Early access through IDES |

---

## 6. PERIODS OF ELIGIBILITY (21.41-21.48)

### Section 21.41 -- Basic period of eligibility

**For veterans discharged BEFORE January 1, 2013:**
- **12-year basic period** beginning on the later of:
  - Date of discharge or release from active service, OR
  - Date VA first notifies the veteran of a qualifying service-connected disability rating
- This 12-year clock does NOT start until VA establishes and notifies the veteran of a qualifying rating

**For veterans discharged ON OR AFTER January 1, 2013:**
- **NO TIME LIMIT on the basic period of eligibility**
- This was established by the VOW to Hire Heroes Act of 2011 (P.L. 112-56)
- If your discharge date is January 1, 2013 or later, you have UNLIMITED time to apply

**For all veterans:**
- The basic period does NOT run while a veteran has a qualifying compensable rating that has not yet been established and communicated by VA
- If VA was slow in rating your disability, that delay does NOT count against your 12-year window

### Section 21.42 -- Deferral or extension of the basic period of eligibility

VA may defer or extend the basic period when:
- The veteran had a **medical condition** that prevented participation in a rehabilitation program during the basic period
- The medical condition must have been of such nature and severity as to have prevented the veteran from beginning or continuing a rehabilitation program
- The extension is for the period during which the medical condition prevented participation

### Section 21.44 -- Extension for serious employment handicap

**This is a powerful provision for pre-2013 veterans:**
- A CP or VRC may extend the basic period for a veteran with a **serious employment handicap**
- The extension covers whatever additional period is needed to accomplish rehabilitation
- There is NO specific limit on the length of the extension
- This effectively eliminates the 12-year cap for veterans with SEH

### Section 21.45 -- Extension for independent living beyond basic period

- Independent living programs may extend beyond the basic 12-year period
- Requires a finding that the veteran has a serious employment handicap
- Independent living services must be needed to achieve maximum independence

### Section 21.46 -- Veteran ordered to active duty; extension

When a veteran is recalled to active duty during the basic period of eligibility:
- The basic period is **extended** for the duration of active duty **plus 4 months**
- This ensures recalled veterans do not lose eligibility time due to military service

### Section 21.47 -- Eligibility for employment assistance

- A veteran who has completed rehabilitation to the point of employability is eligible for employment assistance
- This eligibility continues even after the basic period of eligibility has expired
- Employment assistance includes job placement, job development, and post-employment support

### Section 21.48 -- Severance of service-connection / reduction to noncompensable degree

**If the disability rating is reduced to 0% (noncompensable):**
- A veteran who has ALREADY been inducted into a rehabilitation program **may continue** to receive services
- The reduction does NOT terminate an active program

**If service-connection is severed entirely:**
- Eligibility for VR&E services is terminated
- However, any benefits already received are not subject to recoupment solely because of the severance

---

## 7. INITIAL AND EXTENDED EVALUATION (21.50-21.58)

### Section 21.50 -- Initial evaluation

This is what happens at or after your appointment. VA provides an initial evaluation to every applicant who files VA Form 28-1900 and meets the disability requirements of Section 21.40.

**During the initial evaluation, a CP or VRC will determine:**
1. Whether the veteran has an **employment handicap** (per Section 21.51)
2. Whether an individual with an employment handicap has a **serious employment handicap** (per Section 21.52)
3. Whether the achievement of a **vocational goal is currently reasonably feasible** (per Section 21.53)

**The evaluation process includes:**
- Review of military service records
- Review of medical records and disability ratings
- Assessment of educational background and work history
- Vocational testing and aptitude assessment (if needed)
- Personal interview with the veteran
- Review of any other relevant documentation

**Your role:** Come prepared with documentation of how your disability affects your ability to work. Bring medical records, employment history, educational transcripts, and any documentation showing the impact of your disability on your career.

### Section 21.51 -- Determining employment handicap

An employment handicap will be found to exist ONLY if a CP or VRC determines:

**(a) Vocational impairment exists:**
The veteran has an impairment of the ability to prepare for, obtain, or keep employment in an occupation consistent with abilities, aptitudes, and interests.

**(b) The impairment has NOT been overcome:**
The veteran has not overcome the effects of the impairment through employment in, or qualifying for employment in, a suitable occupation.

**Contributing factors to employment handicap include:**
- Effects of service-connected disabilities (the primary factor)
- Effects of nonservice-connected disabilities that compound the service-connected condition
- Lack of or deficiencies in education or training
- Negative attitudes toward disabled persons (societal barriers)
- History of adjustment problems in training or employment
- Long periods of unemployment
- Lack of current marketable skills
- Effects of the veteran's having been a prisoner of war

**Important:** The employment handicap does NOT have to be caused SOLELY by the service-connected disability. It can be a combination of factors as long as the service-connected disability contributes materially to the impairment.

**What is NOT an employment handicap:**
- If you are currently employed in a suitable occupation at an appropriate wage, you may be found NOT to have an employment handicap
- If your disability has been fully accommodated and you are succeeding at work, the handicap may be considered "overcome"

### Section 21.52 -- Determining serious employment handicap

A serious employment handicap (SEH) exists when there is a SIGNIFICANT vocational impairment. This is determined by evaluating:

1. **Severity of disability:** More severe disabilities are more likely to create a serious employment handicap. A 50% or higher rating is strong evidence, but is not automatically sufficient.

2. **Duration and type of disability:** Chronic, permanent conditions weigh more heavily than temporary conditions.

3. **Nonservice-connected conditions:** If nonservice-connected disabilities compound the service-connected disability effects, this supports a SEH finding.

4. **Educational and vocational history:** Limited education, few marketable skills, or a narrow work history support a SEH finding.

5. **Prior rehabilitation attempts:** If previous attempts at rehabilitation have been unsuccessful, this supports SEH.

6. **Adjustment problems:** History of difficulty adjusting to training or employment.

**The key word is "significant."** The difference between an employment handicap and a serious employment handicap is the degree of impairment. A serious employment handicap indicates a more profound barrier to employment.

**Why this matters for your appointment:**
- If you have a 10% rating, you MUST be found to have a SEH to be eligible
- If you have a 20%+ rating, a SEH finding unlocks additional benefits including:
  - Extension of the basic eligibility period beyond 12 years (Section 21.44)
  - Greater likelihood of approval for programs exceeding 48 months (Section 21.78)
  - Access to the Independent Living track if employment is not feasible

### Section 21.53 -- Reasonable feasibility of achieving a vocational goal

**A vocational goal is reasonably feasible when:**
The effects of the veteran's disability (service and nonservice-connected), when considered in relation to the veteran's circumstances, do NOT prevent successful completion of a rehabilitation program and attainment of suitable employment.

**A vocational goal is NOT currently reasonably feasible when:**
1. The effects of the veteran's disability prevent successful completion at that time, OR
2. The disability effects are expected to worsen within the period needed to complete the program

**If feasibility cannot be determined during initial evaluation:**
- An extended evaluation is ordered under Section 21.57
- The veteran is placed in "extended evaluation" case status
- An Individualized Extended Evaluation Plan (IEEP) is developed
- The extended evaluation is designed to gather additional information to make the feasibility determination

**If a vocational goal IS feasible:** An IWRP is developed, and the veteran enters rehabilitation.

**If a vocational goal is NOT feasible:** The veteran is evaluated for Independent Living services. A vocational goal being infeasible does NOT mean the veteran gets nothing -- it redirects them to the Independent Living track.

### Section 21.57 -- Extended evaluation

**Purpose:** Determine current feasibility of achieving a vocational goal when this determination cannot reasonably be made during the initial evaluation.

**When used:**
- Complex disability situations where the impact on employability is unclear
- When the veteran's medical condition is unstable or changing
- When additional vocational testing or work trials are needed

**Requirements:**
- An IEEP must be developed (Section 21.86)
- The determination must be made at the earliest possible time
- Must be concluded no later than the end of the evaluation period or any extension thereof
- If a vocational goal is found feasible, an IWRP is developed
- If not feasible, the veteran is evaluated for Independent Living

### Section 21.58 -- Redetermination of employment handicap and serious employment handicap

**Prior to induction into a program:**
- The determination of employment handicap or SEH will NOT be changed except for **clear and unmistakable error** of fact or law
- This protects veterans from arbitrary reversal of favorable findings

**After induction into a program:**
- VA will NOT redetermine employment handicap or SEH because of a disability rating reduction, including reduction to 0%
- Once you are IN the program, a rating decrease does not kick you out
- Only clear and unmistakable error can reverse the determination

**This is a major protection.** Once you are found to have an employment handicap (or SEH) and are inducted into a program, that finding is essentially locked in.

---

## 8. VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION PANEL (21.60-21.62)

### Section 21.60 -- Vocational Rehabilitation Panel

A Vocational Rehabilitation Panel is established at each VA field facility. This is an internal review body that provides technical assistance for complex cases.

**Composition:**
1. A CP or VRC in the VR&E Division (serves as chairperson)
2. A vocational rehabilitation specialist in VR&E
3. A medical consultant from a VA Medical Center
4. A member of Social Services staff from a VAMC
5. Other VA specialists as needed (e.g., psychologists, employment specialists)

### Section 21.62 -- Duties of the Vocational Rehabilitation Panel

The panel provides technical and consultative services when requested by professional staff to:
1. Assist in planning and carrying out rehabilitation programs for **seriously disabled veterans** and their dependents
2. Consider other cases of individuals eligible for Chapter 31 and other VA education programs
3. **Ensure that seriously disabled veterans who need independent living services are provided necessary services**

**Why this matters:** If your case is complex or involves severe disabilities, the VR Panel may review your plan. This is generally a positive step as the panel brings multi-disciplinary expertise. If you feel your VRC is not properly addressing your needs, you can request that your case be reviewed by the panel.

---

## 9. DURATION OF REHABILITATION PROGRAMS (21.70-21.79)

### Section 21.70 -- Vocational rehabilitation

The basic period of entitlement for vocational rehabilitation services shall not exceed **48 months** except as provided in Section 21.78.

**This 48-month cap includes:**
- All training under Chapter 31
- Combined usage with other VA education benefits (Chapter 30, 33, 35, etc.)

**This 48-month cap does NOT include:**
- Evaluation and planning time
- Employment services time
- Extended evaluation time
- These periods are "free" and do not count against the 48-month cap

### Section 21.72 -- Rehabilitation to the point of employability

- The estimated duration of training must be incorporated into the IWRP
- The training period should be "reasonable" for the chosen vocational goal
- When estimated training time exceeds 48 months, **concurrence of the VR&E Officer** is required (see Section 21.78)
- The CP/VRC must concur that the training period is appropriate for the chosen occupation

**Practical meaning:** A 4-year bachelor's degree program = 48 months exactly, which fits within the standard cap. A program requiring prerequisites plus a degree might exceed 48 months and need VR&E Officer approval.

### Section 21.73 -- Duration of employment assistance programs

- Employment assistance follows completion of rehabilitation to the point of employability
- Duration varies based on the veteran's needs
- Not subject to the 48-month overall cap
- Continues until the veteran obtains and maintains suitable employment for 60 days, or the case is otherwise closed

### Section 21.74 -- Extended evaluation duration

- The duration of extended evaluation is determined by the complexity of the veteran's situation
- Should be concluded at the earliest possible time
- Not subject to the 48-month cap

### Section 21.76 -- Independent living duration

- A program of independent living services shall not exceed **24 months**
- An extension of up to **6 additional months** is possible if the VRC determines:
  - A longer period is necessary, AND
  - The longer period is likely to result in a substantial increase in independence
- **Total maximum: 30 months**

### Section 21.78 -- Approving more than 48 months of rehabilitation

**This section is critical for veterans needing longer programs.**

Extensions beyond 48 months of total entitlement (under ALL VA programs combined) require:
1. **Approval of the CP or VRC**, AND
2. **Concurrence of the VR&E Officer** (also called the Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Officer, or VREO) or their designee

**Extensions may be approved when:**
- The veteran has a **serious employment handicap**
- The additional time is necessary to complete a rehabilitation program
- The assistance to be provided in excess of 48 months consists ONLY of employment assistance services (employment assistance does not count against the cap regardless)

**In practice:** If you need a graduate degree, professional certification, or extensive retraining that will take longer than 48 months, you can get approval -- but it requires the VR&E Officer's sign-off and you should have (or seek) a serious employment handicap finding.

### Section 21.79 -- Determining entitlement usage under Chapter 31

Establishes how months of entitlement are calculated and tracked:
- Full-time pursuit = 1 month of entitlement per calendar month
- Three-quarter time = 0.75 months of entitlement per calendar month
- Half-time = 0.5 months of entitlement per calendar month
- Quarter-time = 0.25 months of entitlement per calendar month

## 10. INDIVIDUALIZED WRITTEN REHABILITATION PLAN (21.80-21.96)

### Section 21.80 -- Requirement for a rehabilitation plan

An individualized plan MUST be developed for each eligible veteran before services are provided. No services (other than initial evaluation) can be authorized without an approved plan.

### Section 21.82 -- Completing the plan under Chapter 31

The plan must be completed as a prerequisite to providing training and rehabilitation services beyond initial evaluation.

### Section 21.84 -- IWRP (Individualized Written Rehabilitation Plan)

This is the PRIMARY plan for veterans pursuing employment. An IWRP must include:

1. **Long-range vocational goal:** The specific occupation or type of employment the veteran will pursue
2. **Intermediate rehabilitation objectives:** Step-by-step milestones leading to the vocational goal (e.g., complete prerequisites, obtain degree, obtain licensure)
3. **Specific services to be provided:** Education, training, counseling, medical services, supplies, employment assistance, etc.
4. **Projected dates:** Start date, intermediate milestone dates, anticipated completion date
5. **Evaluation criteria:** How progress will be measured
6. **Responsibilities of the veteran and VA:** What each party is expected to do

**The IWRP is a CONTRACT between you and VA.** Both parties must agree to its terms.

### Section 21.86 -- IEEP (Individualized Extended Evaluation Plan)

Used when an extended evaluation is needed to determine feasibility. The IEEP:
- Identifies the specific evaluation services and procedures to be used
- Specifies the timeline for the evaluation
- Describes the criteria for determining feasibility

### Section 21.88 -- IEAP (Individualized Employment Assistance Plan)

Developed after rehabilitation to employability is achieved. The IEAP:
- Ensures a comprehensive approach to securing suitable employment
- Specifies job placement services, job development activities, and post-employment support
- Includes goals such as resume preparation, interview coaching, employer outreach, and accommodations

### Section 21.90 -- IILP (Individualized Independent Living Plan)

For veterans whose disabilities are so severe that a vocational goal is not currently feasible. The IILP:
- Identifies specific steps for the veteran to become more independent in daily living
- Specifies services such as assistive technology, home modifications, skills training
- Must be developed jointly with the veteran (per Section 21.92)
- Requires VR&E Officer concurrence (per Section 21.162)

### Section 21.92 -- Preparation of the plan

**THE PLAN IS JOINTLY DEVELOPED.** This is one of the most important provisions for your appointment.

- The plan is developed by VA staff AND the veteran TOGETHER
- Terms and conditions must be approved and agreed to by:
  - The Counseling Psychologist (CP) or Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC)
  - The vocational rehabilitation specialist
  - **The veteran** (YOUR agreement is required)
- You have the right to participate fully in developing the plan
- You have the right to disagree with proposed terms
- VA cannot unilaterally impose a plan on you without your agreement

**At your appointment:** The VRC will discuss your background, interests, aptitudes, and disability impact. Based on this discussion, a plan will be developed. You should come prepared with ideas about what career field you want to pursue. Do NOT be passive -- actively participate in shaping your plan.

### Section 21.94 -- Changing the plan

**Any party can request a change at any time:**
- The veteran
- The CP or VRC
- The vocational rehabilitation specialist

**Changing the long-range vocational goal requires:**
1. A reevaluation of the rehabilitation program by the CP or VRC
2. A finding that either:
   - Achievement of the current goal is no longer reasonably feasible, OR
   - The veteran's circumstances have changed making a different goal more suitable, OR
   - New information has been developed supporting a different goal
3. The veteran's full participation and concurrence in the change

**Changing intermediate objectives or services:**
- May be made by the case manager (VRC) when necessary to carry out the long-range goal
- Does NOT require the same level of formal reevaluation as changing the goal itself
- The veteran should still be informed and consulted

**Practical tip:** If your original plan is not working out, you CAN change it. Do not feel locked into a plan that is not serving you well. Request a plan change through your VRC.

### Section 21.96 -- Review of the plan

- Plans are subject to **periodic review** to ensure they remain appropriate
- Review considers progress toward goals, changed circumstances, and any new information
- The VRC is responsible for monitoring and reviewing the plan
- Reviews typically occur at least annually, but may be more frequent
- The veteran should receive notice of reviews and have the opportunity to provide input

---

## 11. COUNSELING (21.100)

### Section 21.100 -- Counseling

Professional counseling services by VR&E staff are provided to:

1. **Carry out initial evaluations** -- This is the appointment you are preparing for
2. **Develop rehabilitation plans** or employment services plans for eligible veterans
3. **Assist veterans found ineligible** for Chapter 31 services (even if you are found ineligible, you are entitled to counseling about alternative options)
4. **Overcome problems** that arise during the course of the rehabilitation program or program of employment services

**Who provides counseling:**
- Counseling Psychologists (CP) or Vocational Rehabilitation Counselors (VRC) in the VR&E Division
- If the veteran resides outside a State, counseling may be provided through contracts with qualified persons

**Scope of counseling services includes:**
- Vocational assessment and aptitude testing
- Career exploration and guidance
- Personal adjustment counseling related to disability and employment
- Educational advising
- Crisis intervention when program problems arise
- Family counseling when it supports the rehabilitation plan

- The course is required for the vocational goal
- Repetition is approved by the VRC

### Section 21.134 -- Limitation on flight training
Special limitations apply to aviation training under Chapter 31. Flight training is generally approved only when it is part of a degree program at an institution of higher learning, or when the veteran's vocational goal specifically requires a pilot's license.

---

## 13. SPECIAL REHABILITATION SERVICES (21.140-21.156)

### Section 21.140 -- Evaluation and improvement of rehabilitation potential
Services to assess and improve a veteran's readiness for rehabilitation, including:
- Vocational evaluation
- Work adjustment training
- Personal adjustment training
- Prevocational services

### Section 21.142 -- Adult basic education
Basic education services for veterans who need foundational skills before beginning vocational training:

- Modified vehicle assistance
- Public transportation subsidies
- Mileage reimbursement for necessary travel

### Section 21.155 -- Services to a veteran's family
Services may be provided to the veteran's family when necessary to carry out the rehabilitation plan. This can include:
- Counseling for family members
- Training family members to assist the veteran
- Other services that directly support the veteran's rehabilitation

### Section 21.156 -- Other incidental goods and services
Additional goods and services not otherwise specified that are necessary for the veteran's rehabilitation. This is a broad "catch-all" provision that allows VA to provide items and services that do not fit neatly into other categories.

---

## 14. INDEPENDENT LIVING SERVICES (21.160-21.162)

### Section 21.160 -- Independent living services

**Purpose:** Assist eligible veterans whose ability to function independently in family, community, or employment is so limited by the severity of disability (service AND nonservice-connected) that vocational or rehabilitation services need to be appreciably more extensive than for less disabled veterans.

**"Independence in daily living"** means the ability of a veteran, without the services of others or with a reduced level of the services of others, to live and function within the veteran's family and community.

**Services may include:**
- Assistive technology and adaptive equipment
- Home modifications for accessibility (ramps, widened doorways, bathroom modifications, etc.)
- Independent living skills training (cooking, cleaning, personal care, financial management)
- Community integration services
- Counseling and personal adjustment
- Services to the veteran's family (per Section 21.155)
- Connection to community resources
- Volunteer and community engagement opportunities
- Transportation assistance

### Section 21.162 -- Participation in a program of independent living services

A program of independent living is approved ONLY when ALL of the following conditions are met:

1. VA determines that achievement of a vocational goal is **NOT currently reasonably feasible**
2. VA determines that the veteran's independence in daily living **CAN be improved**, and the gains can reasonably be expected to continue following completion of the program
3. All steps required by Sections 21.90 and 21.92 for the development and preparation of an Individualized Independent Living Plan (IILP) have been completed
4. The **VR&E Officer concurs** in the IILP (this requires higher-level approval than a standard IWRP)

**Duration:** Maximum 24 months, extendable up to 6 additional months (30 months total) per Section 21.76.

**Key point:** Independent Living is NOT a dead end. If a veteran's condition improves during or after independent living services, they can be reevaluated for vocational rehabilitation. The determination of "not currently reasonably feasible" is just that -- a CURRENT determination, not a permanent one.

---

## 15. CASE STATUS SYSTEM (21.180-21.198)

### Section 21.180 -- Case status system

Every veteran's case is assigned a specific status from initial contact through completion. The status indicates where the veteran is in the rehabilitation process and determines what services are currently authorized.

### The Case Statuses:

| Section | Status Name | Description |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| 21.182 | **Applicant** | Application filed; initial contact established. Veteran has submitted VA Form 28-1900. |
| 21.184 | **Evaluation and Planning** | Initial evaluation is being conducted. CP/VRC is assessing employment handicap, SEH, and feasibility. |
| 21.186 | **Ineligible** | Found not eligible for Chapter 31 services. Veteran was evaluated and did not meet entitlement criteria. |
| 21.188 | **Extended Evaluation** | Extended evaluation is in progress under an IEEP. Feasibility could not be determined during initial evaluation. |
| 21.190 | **Rehabilitation to the Point of Employability** | Active training/education program. Veteran is pursuing the IWRP. This is the main training status. |
| 21.192 | **Independent Living Program** | Independent living services are being provided under an IILP. |
| 21.194 | **Employment Services** | Training is complete; job placement and employment assistance are being provided under an IEAP. |
| 21.196 | **Rehabilitated** | Program successfully completed. Veteran has achieved rehabilitation goals. |
| 21.197 | **Interrupted** | Program temporarily suspended. May be due to medical issues, personal circumstances, or conduct/cooperation issues. |
| 21.198 | **Discontinued** | Program terminated. Case is closed. |

### Typical Progression Paths:

**Standard vocational rehabilitation path:**
Applicant --> Evaluation and Planning --> Rehabilitation to Employability --> Employment Services --> Rehabilitated

**Extended evaluation path:**
Applicant --> Evaluation and Planning --> Extended Evaluation --> (then to Rehabilitation to Employability OR Independent Living)

**Independent living path:**
Applicant --> Evaluation and Planning --> Independent Living Program --> Rehabilitated

**Ineligibility path:**
Applicant --> Evaluation and Planning --> Ineligible

**Interruption/discontinuation:**
Any active status --> Interrupted --> (either return to prior status OR Discontinued)

---

## 16. SUPPLIES (21.210-21.224)

### Section 21.210 -- Supplies
VA furnishes supplies necessary for the rehabilitation program. "Supplies" is a broad term covering everything the veteran needs for training.

### Section 21.212 -- General policy in furnishing supplies during periods of rehabilitation
A veteran will be furnished all supplies necessary to pursue the rehabilitation program, including:
- Textbooks and course materials
- Professional tools and equipment
- Computer and software (when required for training)
- Lab materials and supplies
- Uniforms and work clothing (when required by the program)
- Professional reference materials
- Any other items necessary for successful program completion

### Section 21.214 -- Furnishing supplies for special programs
Additional or specialized supplies for unique training situations (e.g., art supplies for an art program, culinary equipment for a cooking program).

### Section 21.216 -- Special equipment
Equipment needed to compensate for disability effects during training:
- Assistive technology devices
- Adaptive computing equipment
- Modified tools and workstations
- Hearing aids and visual aids (beyond what VA medical provides)
- Ergonomic equipment
- Any specialized equipment needed due to the disability

### Section 21.218 -- Methods of furnishing supplies
VA may provide supplies by:
- Direct purchase and delivery
- Reimbursement to the veteran (with prior authorization)
- Rental or lease
- Loan of VA-owned equipment

### Section 21.219 -- Supplies consisting of clothing, magazines, and personally used items
Limitations on personal-use items. Items that would primarily benefit the veteran personally rather than support the training program are generally not provided.

### Section 21.220 -- Replacement of supplies
Supplies that are lost, damaged, or worn out during the program may be replaced at VA expense when:
- The loss/damage was not due to the veteran's fault or neglect
- The item is still needed for the program

### Section 21.224 -- Prevention of abuse
Safeguards against improper use of furnished supplies. VA may require accountability for expensive items and may require return of items at program completion.

---

## 17. MEDICAL AND RELATED SERVICES (21.240-21.242)

### Section 21.240 -- Medical treatment, care, and services

VA may provide or arrange for medical treatment necessary to enable a veteran to participate in a rehabilitation program. This includes:

- Treatment to resolve medical conditions that prevent or hinder participation in rehabilitation
- Prosthetics and sensory aids needed for training or employment
- Mental health treatment (counseling, therapy, psychiatric medication)
- Substance abuse treatment
- Physical therapy and occupational therapy
- Dental treatment when it directly affects the veteran's ability to participate
- Treatment not otherwise available through standard VA healthcare

**Key point:** This is IN ADDITION to standard VA healthcare. If a medical issue is preventing you from pursuing your rehabilitation plan, VR&E can authorize treatment to address that barrier.

### Section 21.242 -- Resources for provision of treatment, care, and services

VA may provide medical services through:
- VA medical centers and clinics
- Community Care (non-VA providers under contract)
- Arrangements with state or local agencies
- Contracts with private providers

---

## 18. EMPLOYMENT SERVICES (21.250-21.258)

### Section 21.250 -- Overview of employment services

Employment services encompass all counseling, medical, social, and other placement and post-placement services provided to help a veteran obtain or maintain suitable employment. These services come AFTER rehabilitation to the point of employability.

### Section 21.252 -- Job development and placement services

VA provides direct job placement assistance including:
- Job readiness preparation and soft skills training
- Resume development and cover letter assistance
- Interview preparation and coaching
- Job search strategies and techniques
- Direct job placement services (VA contacts employers on your behalf)
- Coordination with employers for workplace accommodations
- Labor market information and analysis
- Referral to the Department of Labor for additional services

### Section 21.254 -- Supportive services

Post-placement support to help the veteran maintain employment, including:
- Follow-up contact with the veteran and employer
- Problem resolution when workplace issues arise
- Adjustment counseling
- Additional accommodations if needed
- Support for at least the first 60 days of employment

### Section 21.256 -- Incentives for employers

VA may provide incentives to employers who hire veterans with disabilities, including:
- On-the-job training wages (VA pays a portion of the training wage)
- Information about tax credits available to employers (Work Opportunity Tax Credit)
- Consultation on disability accommodation
- Ongoing support to the employer

### Section 21.257 -- Self-employment

Self-employment may be an appropriate vocational goal when VA determines it is suitable. Key provisions:

- Individuals with the most severe service-connected disabilities who require self-employment are those whose limitations are so severe that self-employment is the ONLY reasonably feasible goal
- VA conducts a **comprehensive feasibility analysis** of the proposed business plan before approving
- The VRC evaluates the viability of the proposed business including:
  - Market analysis
  - Financial projections
  - The veteran's business skills and experience
  - The relationship between the business and the veteran's disability
  - Likelihood of success

**Services for self-employment include:**
- Business plan development assistance
- Training in business management, marketing, accounting, and finance
- Startup supplies, equipment, and inventory
- Licensing and certification costs
- Technical assistance during the startup phase
- Software and technology needed for the business

### Section 21.258 -- Cost limitations on approval of self-employment plans

**Two approval tiers:**

| Estimated Cost | Approval Authority |
|---------------|-------------------|
| **Less than $25,000** | VR&E Officer with jurisdiction (local level) |
| **$25,000 or more** | Executive Director, VR&E Service (NATIONAL level approval required) |

**What counts toward the cost:**
- All goods, services, and assistance provided by VA for the self-employment plan
- Equipment, supplies, inventory
- Training costs
- Licensing and professional fees
- Any other VA-funded expenses

**Practical tip:** If your self-employment plan is near the $25,000 threshold, the local VR&E Officer has a much faster approval process. Plans at or above $25,000 must go through national headquarters and can take significantly longer.

---

## 19. MONETARY ASSISTANCE / SUBSISTENCE ALLOWANCE (21.260-21.276)

### Section 21.260 -- Subsistence allowance

A veteran participating in rehabilitation under Chapter 31 receives a monthly subsistence allowance. The amount depends on:
- **Type of training** (institutional, on-job, farm cooperative, independent study, etc.)
- **Rate of pursuit** (full-time, 3/4 time, 1/2 time, 1/4 time)
- **Number of dependents** (no dependents, one dependent, two dependents, each additional)

### FY2026 SUBSISTENCE ALLOWANCE RATES (Effective October 1, 2025):

**Institutional Training (College, University, Vocational School):**

| Rate of Pursuit | No Dependents | 1 Dependent | 2 Dependents | Each Additional |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Full-Time | $812.84 | $1,008.24 | $1,188.15 | +$86.58 |
| Three-Quarter | $610.76 | $757.28 | $888.32 | +$66.60 |
| Half-Time | $408.66 | $506.32 | $595.16 | +$44.42 |
| Quarter-Time | $204.30 | $253.20 | $297.59 | +$22.16 |

**On-Job Training, Independent Instructor, Farm Cooperative, Apprenticeship:**
Rates vary; generally comparable to institutional full-time rates. On-job training rates may be reduced as the veteran's training wage increases.

**Maximum Monthly Rate:** $3,439.23 (for specific high-cost circumstances)

**Important: These rates are SEPARATE from your disability compensation.** You receive subsistence allowance IN ADDITION to your VA disability compensation. They do not offset each other.

### Section 21.262 -- Procurement and reimbursement of costs

VA pays directly for:
- Tuition and fees
- Books and supplies
- Equipment
- Other authorized training costs

These payments go directly to the training facility or vendor. The veteran does NOT need to pay out of pocket and seek reimbursement (in most cases).

### Section 21.264 -- Election of Post-9/11 subsistence allowance

**THIS IS A CRITICAL PROVISION -- PAY ATTENTION.**

A veteran eligible for Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) benefits may elect to receive the **Post-9/11 subsistence allowance rate** instead of the standard Chapter 31 subsistence rate.

**Why this matters:** The Post-9/11 rate is based on the **Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) for an E-5 with dependents** at the ZIP code of the training facility. In most areas of the country, this is SIGNIFICANTLY higher than the standard Chapter 31 subsistence rate.

**Example comparison:**
- Standard Chapter 31 full-time, no dependents: $812.84/month
- Post-9/11 BAH rate in Portland, OR: approximately $2,400-2,700/month
- Post-9/11 BAH rate in Washington, DC: approximately $3,000-3,400/month

**Requirements to elect the Post-9/11 rate:**
1. You must have remaining Chapter 33 entitlement
2. You must formally elect the Post-9/11 rate
3. Both Chapter 31 AND Chapter 33 entitlement will be charged simultaneously

**Trade-off:** Electing the Post-9/11 rate consumes BOTH your Chapter 31 and Chapter 33 entitlement months. If you do NOT elect the Post-9/11 rate, only your Chapter 31 entitlement is consumed, preserving your Chapter 33 entitlement for later use.

**Ask your VRC about this at your appointment.** In most cases, the higher monthly payment is worth the dual entitlement charge, but your situation may differ.

### Section 21.266 -- Payment of subsistence allowance under special conditions

- Veterans hospitalized in a VA or VA-funded hospital may receive subsistence allowance while participating in rehabilitation
- Veterans in on-job training receive subsistence allowance that cannot exceed the difference between the training wage and the journeyman (full) entrance wage for the occupation

### Section 21.268 -- Employment adjustment allowance

An allowance paid during the employment adjustment period following completion of training. This provides financial support while the veteran transitions from training to employment.

### Section 21.270 -- Payment of subsistence allowance during leave and other periods

Rules for continued subsistence during authorized leave periods:
- Subsistence continues during approved leave periods between terms
- Payment continues during facility-scheduled breaks (holidays, between quarters/semesters)
- Payment stops during unauthorized absences

### Section 21.272 -- Veteran-student services

Veterans enrolled in Chapter 31 may work as VA work-study students, providing additional income. Work-study positions are available at VA facilities, state veterans affairs offices, and other approved sites.

### Section 21.274 -- Revolving fund loan

VA may make **advance payments** from a revolving fund when a veteran needs funds before the first regular subsistence payment is processed. This prevents veterans from going without income while waiting for the initial payment.

**If you are in financial hardship:** Ask your VRC about an advance from the revolving fund at your appointment.

### Section 21.276 -- Incarcerated veterans

- Veterans convicted of a felony and incarcerated in a prison or jail may NOT receive subsistence allowance
- However, VA MAY still pay tuition, fees, and other training costs
- Veterans in a halfway house or work-release program MAY receive full subsistence allowance
- Veterans in a pre-trial detention facility are NOT considered "incarcerated" and may receive full benefits

---

## 20. INDUCTION INTO A REHABILITATION PROGRAM (21.282-21.284)

### Section 21.282 -- Effective date of induction; retroactive induction

- The effective date of induction into a rehabilitation program is governed by Sections 21.320-21.334
- **Retroactive induction is possible:** If a veteran began training before being formally inducted, VA may authorize payment for tuition, fees, and verified expenses retroactively
- This protects veterans who start school before their VR&E approval is finalized

### Section 21.283 -- Rehabilitated

A veteran is considered "rehabilitated" and the case is closed in "rehabilitated" status when:

**For vocational rehabilitation:**
- The veteran has completed rehabilitation to the point of employability, AND
- The veteran has obtained and maintained suitable employment for a minimum of **60 consecutive days**

**For independent living:**
- The veteran has completed the independent living program, AND
- The veteran has achieved the goals of the IILP (increased independence in daily living)

**What "suitable employment" means for the 60-day requirement:**
- The employment does not worsen the veteran's disability
- The employment is stable and not temporary
- The employment is consistent with the veteran's abilities, aptitudes, and interests
- The employment provides adequate income

### Section 21.284 -- Reentrance into a rehabilitation program

A previously rehabilitated veteran may receive additional training and services if:

1. The veteran has a compensable service-connected disability, AND either:
2. The service-connected disability has **WORSENED** to the extent that it precludes performing the duties of the occupation for which the veteran was previously rehabilitated, OR
3. The occupation for which the veteran was previously rehabilitated is found to be **unsuitable** based on the veteran's specific employment handicap and capabilities

**This is important:** Even if you have already been through VR&E and were "rehabilitated," you can come back if your condition worsens or if the previous plan did not lead to sustainable employment.

---

## 21. COURSE APPROVAL AND FACILITY SELECTION (21.290-21.299)

### Section 21.290 -- Training and rehabilitation resources
All facilities providing Chapter 31 services must meet VA standards for quality, safety, and effectiveness.

### Section 21.292 -- Course approvals
Only VA-approved courses may be used for Chapter 31 training. The State Approving Agency (SAA) reviews and approves courses for VA purposes. Most accredited institutions and established vocational programs have already been approved.

### Section 21.294 -- Selecting the training or rehabilitation facility
Each facility must have:
- Adequate space and equipment
- Appropriate instructional materials
- Qualified instructor personnel
- Accessibility for veterans with disabilities
- A track record of successful training outcomes

**The veteran's preference is considered** but VA has final say on facility selection. If the veteran prefers a specific school, the VRC will generally approve it if it meets standards and is appropriate for the vocational goal.

### Section 21.296 -- Selecting a training establishment for on-job training
On-job training establishments must:
- Provide adequate supervision and instruction
- Pay a fair wage during training
- Offer a realistic prospect of permanent employment upon training completion
- Meet OSHA and other workplace safety standards

### Section 21.298 -- Selecting a farm
Specific requirements for farm cooperative training locations including adequate land, equipment, and agricultural mentorship.

### Section 21.299 -- Use of Government facilities for on-job training or work experience
Government facilities (VA, federal agencies, state agencies) may be used for on-job training or work experience at no or nominal pay. This is particularly useful for veterans seeking government employment.

---

## 22. RATE OF PURSUIT (21.310-21.314)

### Section 21.310 -- Rate of pursuit of a rehabilitation program

The "rate of pursuit" determines the fraction of full-time training:

| Rate | Credit Hours (per semester) | Clock Hours (per week) |
|------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Full-Time | 12+ credits (undergrad); 9+ (graduate) | 30+ hours |
| Three-Quarter | 9-11 credits (undergrad); 7-8 (graduate) | 22-29 hours |
| Half-Time | 6-8 credits (undergrad); 5-6 (graduate) | 15-21 hours |
| Quarter-Time | 3-5 credits (undergrad); 3-4 (graduate) | 7-14 hours |

**Full-time pursuit is generally expected** unless there are medical or disability-related reasons for part-time pursuit.

### Section 21.312 -- Reduced work tolerance

Veterans whose ability to pursue training is reduced by disability effects may participate at a reduced rate. Key provisions:
- The reduction must be due to the effects of the veteran's disability (service-connected or nonservice-connected when combined with service-connected)
- A medical opinion supporting reduced pursuit may be required
- Subsistence allowance is adjusted to match the actual rate of pursuit
- **However:** When reduced pursuit is due to disability, the VRC may authorize full-time subsistence at a reduced pursuit rate in certain circumstances

### Section 21.314 -- Pursuit of training under special conditions

Veterans may pursue training at a lesser rate under certain circumstances:
- Medical limitations requiring reduced course load
- Combined training and employment situations
- Family obligations that necessitate part-time pursuit (with VRC approval)
- Other circumstances where the VRC determines a reduced rate is appropriate

---

## 23. AUTHORIZATION OF SUBSISTENCE ALLOWANCE AND SERVICES (21.320-21.334)

### Section 21.320 -- Awards for subsistence allowance and authorization of rehabilitation services

**Commencing date:** Determined under Section 21.322

**Ending date:** The earliest of:
- The ending date specified in the veteran's IWRP or other plan
- The ending date of the enrollment period as certified by the training facility
- The date the veteran's case status changes to interrupted, discontinued, or rehabilitated
- Other triggering events specified in the regulations

**Training authorization dates generally parallel subsistence allowance dates**, with exceptions for employment services (Section 21.326).

### Section 21.322 -- Commencing dates of subsistence allowance

The commencing date is the EARLIER of:
1. The date the facility requires the veteran to report for prescribed activities (e.g., orientation day)
2. The date training or rehabilitation services actually begin

**Exception for retroactive induction:** If retroactive induction is authorized under Section 21.282, the commencing date may be earlier than the formal induction date.

### Section 21.324 -- Reduction or termination dates of subsistence allowance

Subsistence is reduced or terminated upon the EARLIEST of these events:
- Completion of the program
- End of the enrollment period
- Failure to maintain satisfactory conduct or cooperation
- Felony incarceration (at the later of incarceration date or award commencing date)
- The veteran's request to end the program
- VA determination that the program should be discontinued
- Reduction in rate of pursuit (subsistence adjusted accordingly)
- Loss of a dependent (affects the rate, not termination)
- Other specified regulatory events

### Section 21.326 -- Authorization of employment services

Commencing and ending dates for employment services are determined separately from training services. Employment services can continue after training is complete.

### Section 21.328 -- Two veteran cases -- dependents

When two veterans in the same household both receive VR&E benefits:
- Each veteran is paid based on their own rate of pursuit and dependency status
- A dependent child can be claimed by only ONE of the two veterans for subsistence purposes

### Section 21.330 -- Apportionment

Subsistence allowance may be apportioned (a portion diverted to a dependent) when:
- A veteran is not reasonably providing for dependents
- A court order requires support payments
- The apportionment does not cause undue hardship to the veteran

### Section 21.332 -- Payments of subsistence allowance

Payments are made monthly, generally at the beginning of the month for the prior month's entitlement.

### Section 21.334 -- Election of payment at the Chapter 30 rate

Procedures for veterans who elect the Montgomery GI Bill rate instead of the standard Chapter 31 rate. (In most cases, the Post-9/11 rate election under Section 21.264 is more beneficial.)

## 24. LEAVES OF ABSENCE (21.340-21.350)

### Section 21.340 -- Introduction
Overview of leave provisions for veterans in Chapter 31 training.

### Section 21.342 -- Leave accounting policy
How leave is tracked and recorded. Veterans in full-time institutional training generally receive 30 days of leave per 12-month period.

### Section 21.344 -- Facility offering training or rehabilitation services
Leave during scheduled breaks of facilities that continue to operate (e.g., summer break at a university). Subsistence continues during approved breaks between terms.

### Section 21.346 -- Facility temporarily not offering training or rehabilitation services
Leave during institutional closures (holidays, breaks between quarters/semesters, weather closures). Subsistence generally continues during scheduled institutional closures.

### Section 21.348 -- Leave following completion of a period of training
Leave provisions after completing a training period but before the next phase begins.

### Section 21.350 -- Unauthorized absences

Unauthorized absences may result in:
- Reduction of subsistence allowance for the period of absence
- Placement in "interrupted" status if absences are prolonged
- Referral for determination of satisfactory conduct and cooperation
- Potential discontinuation of the program

**Bottom line:** Communicate with your VRC about any absences. An explained absence is rarely a problem. An unexplained absence can jeopardize your program.

---

## 25. SATISFACTORY CONDUCT AND COOPERATION (21.362-21.364) -- CRITICAL SECTION

### Section 21.362 -- Satisfactory conduct and cooperation

**VA's obligations to the veteran:**
1. **Inform** the veteran of all available services and assure understanding
2. **Explain** the veteran's specific responsibilities in developing and implementing the plan
3. **Explain** the specific standard for satisfactory conduct and cooperation
4. **Monitor** conduct and cooperation through case management (regular check-ins)
5. **Provide assistance** (especially counseling) to help maintain satisfactory participation

**Standards of conduct and cooperation include:**
- Regular attendance at training sessions and appointments
- Satisfactory academic progress (grades consistent with degree/certificate requirements)
- Active participation in the rehabilitation plan
- Compliance with program rules and institutional standards
- Keeping scheduled appointments with the VRC
- Promptly reporting changes in circumstances (address, dependents, medical conditions)
- Completing assignments and meeting training requirements

**Your right:** VA must clearly inform you of what "satisfactory conduct and cooperation" means for your specific program BEFORE it can be used against you. If you were never told the standard, it cannot be enforced.

### Section 21.364 -- Unsatisfactory conduct and cooperation

When the case manager (VRC) determines conduct or cooperation is unsatisfactory, a **three-step process** applies:

**Step 1 -- Counseling:**
Arrange counseling services to resolve the problems causing unsatisfactory conduct or cooperation. This is NOT punitive -- it is supportive. The VRC should work with you to identify and address the root cause.

**Step 2 -- Interruption:**
If problems persist after counseling, the program is INTERRUPTED (placed in "interrupted" status) for more intense resolution efforts. During interruption:
- The veteran is not in active training
- Subsistence allowance may be suspended
- The VRC continues to work with the veteran to resolve issues
- The goal is to return the veteran to active status

**Step 3 -- Discontinuation:**
If a reasonable effort during the interruption period is unsuccessful, the case is DISCONTINUED and placed in "discontinued" status. The program is terminated.

**EXCEPTION -- Mitigating circumstances:**
If mitigating circumstances exist, the case may remain in "interrupted" status until the veteran can demonstrate that satisfactory conduct and cooperation will resume. Mitigating circumstances include:
- Medical emergencies (including mental health crises)
- Family crises (death, serious illness, domestic issues)
- Natural disasters
- Other factors genuinely beyond the veteran's control

**Your protection:** VA cannot jump straight to discontinuation. They MUST go through the three-step process. If your VRC threatens immediate discontinuation without first offering counseling and then interruption, they are violating the regulations.

**If you are struggling:** Tell your VRC immediately. Ask for help. The regulations require VA to try to help you succeed before taking adverse action.

---

## 26. TRAVEL (21.370-21.376)

### Section 21.370 -- Intraregional travel at government expense
VA may authorize travel within the regional territory when necessary for the rehabilitation program, including:
- Travel to training facilities
- Travel for medical evaluations
- Travel for employment interviews (during employment services)

### Section 21.372 -- Interregional transfer at government expense
Veterans may transfer between VA regional jurisdictions at government expense when necessary for rehabilitation (e.g., relocating to attend an approved training program in another state).

### Section 21.374 -- Authorization for travel of attendants
When a veteran's disability is so severe that an attendant is needed for travel:
- The attendant receives the same travel reimbursement as the veteran
- The attendant must be necessary due to the severity of the veteran's disability

### Section 21.376 -- Travel expenses for initial evaluation and counseling
**When VA asks a veteran to report for initial evaluation, reevaluation, or counseling, travel is at GOVERNMENT EXPENSE.** This means:
- If you travel to your VR&E appointment at VA's request, you can be reimbursed for travel costs
- This includes mileage, public transportation, tolls, and parking
- Ask about travel reimbursement at your appointment

---

## 27. PERSONNEL AND RESEARCH (21.380-21.390)

### Section 21.380 -- Establishment of qualifications for personnel providing assistance
Qualification standards for CPs, VRCs, and other VR&E staff. These professionals must have specific educational qualifications and training.

### Section 21.382 -- Training and staff development for personnel
Continuing education and professional development requirements for VR&E staff. Your VRC should be trained and current on program requirements.

### Section 21.390 -- Rehabilitation research and special projects

---

## 29. ADMINISTRATIVE (21.410-21.430)

### Section 21.410 -- Delegation of authority
Specifies which VA officials have authority to make various VR&E decisions. Some decisions can be made by the VRC, others require the VR&E Officer, and some require national-level approval.

### Section 21.412 -- Finality of decisions
VR&E decisions become final if not appealed within the specified timeframe. You have the right to appeal unfavorable decisions through the VA appeals process.

### Section 21.414 -- Revision of decision
Conditions under which a previous VR&E decision may be revised:
- Clear and unmistakable error of fact or law
- New and material evidence
- Changed circumstances

### Section 21.416 -- Review of decisions
The appeals process for VR&E decisions:
- Notice of Disagreement (NOD) with the decision
- Statement of the Case (SOC) from VA
- Supplemental claim or appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals
- **You have the right to representation** (VSO, attorney, claims agent) at every stage

### Section 21.420 -- Informing the veteran

VA has an affirmative obligation to inform the veteran of:
- All available program services
- Rights and responsibilities under the program
- Standards for satisfactory conduct and cooperation
- The appeals process for unfavorable decisions
- Changes in program status
- Reasons for any adverse action

**If VA takes action against you without proper notice and explanation, the action may be invalid.**

### Section 21.422 -- Reduction in subsistence allowance following the loss of a dependent

When VA proposes a reduction based on dependency information from a source other than the veteran:

1. VA prepares a **proposal** with material facts and reasons for the reduction
2. **Notifies the veteran** at the latest address of record of the proposed action
3. **Furnishes detailed reasons** for the proposed reduction
4. **Informs the veteran of the right to a predetermination hearing** (request must be made within 30 days)
5. **Gives 60 days** for the veteran to present additional evidence showing the subsistence should continue at its current level
6. **PAYMENTS CONTINUE AT THE CURRENT LEVEL** pending the final determination

**This is a due process protection.** VA cannot reduce your subsistence without notice, explanation, and opportunity to respond.

### Section 21.430 -- Accountability for authorization and payment of training and rehabilitation services

Requirements for proper authorization and accountability of all training and rehabilitation services payments. VA must maintain records of all authorizations and payments.

---

## 30. VETERANS EMPLOYMENT PAY FOR SUCCESS GRANT PROGRAM (21.440-21.449)

### Section 21.440 -- Purpose and scope
Establishes the Veterans Employment Pay for Success (VEPFS) grant program. This is a separate program that funds outcomes-based employment interventions for veterans with service-connected disabilities.

### Section 21.441 -- Definitions
"Eligible entity" means a public or nonprofit agency, including institutions of higher learning. "Pay for Success" (PFS) means an outcomes-based funding model.

### Section 21.442 -- VEPFS grants -- general
Recipients must provide **matching funds from non-Federal sources** equal to or greater than the Federal grant amount.

### Section 21.443 -- Permissible uses of VEPFS grant funds
Funds may only pay for outcomes that achieve **pre-set employment targets** agreed to before service delivery begins. This is not a direct benefit to individual veterans but rather a program that funds organizations helping veterans find employment.

### Sections 21.444-21.449
Cover the application, scoring, selection, grant agreement, reporting, and fund recovery processes for the VEPFS program. These sections are primarily relevant to organizations applying for grants, not to individual veterans.

---

## 31. THE FIVE VR&E TRACKS -- DETAILED BREAKDOWN

The VA organizes VR&E services into five "tracks" or pathways. These are not separate regulatory sections but rather the VA's operational framework for delivering the services authorized by the regulations above.

---

### TRACK 1: REEMPLOYMENT

**Regulatory basis:** 38 CFR 21.250-21.254, 38 U.S.C. 3117

**Purpose:** Help veterans return to their former employer with disability accommodations.

**Typical duration:** Shortest of the five tracks, often 1-6 months.

---

### TRACK 2: RAPID ACCESS TO EMPLOYMENT

**Regulatory basis:** 38 CFR 21.250-21.254, 21.88 (IEAP)

**Regulatory basis:** 38 CFR 21.257-21.258

**Purpose:** Help veterans start their own businesses when self-employment is determined to be a suitable vocational goal.

**Who it is for:**

**Who it is for:**
- Veterans whose service-connected disability makes it impossible to continue in their prior field
- Veterans who need substantial retraining for a new career
- Veterans pursuing college degrees, vocational certificates, or professional licensure
- Veterans who need foundational education before vocational training

**This is the MOST COMMONLY USED track** and corresponds to the full IWRP under 38 CFR 21.84.

**Services provided:**
- Full tuition and fees for college, university, vocational school, or technical school
- Books, tools, supplies, and equipment (all costs covered)
- Subsistence allowance (or Post-9/11 BAH rate if elected -- see Section 21.264)

**Typical duration:** 2-4 years, but can be longer with VR&E Officer approval.

---

### TRACK 5: INDEPENDENT LIVING

**Regulatory basis:** 38 CFR 21.160-21.162, 21.76, 21.90

**Purpose:** Help veterans with severe disabilities become more independent in daily living when immediate employment is not feasible.

**Who it is for:**
- Veterans whose service-connected disability is so severe that a vocational goal is NOT currently reasonably feasible
- Veterans whose independence in daily living CAN be improved with services
- Veterans who may eventually transition to vocational rehabilitation but are not ready now

**ALL four conditions must be met (per Section 21.162):**
1. VA determines a vocational goal is NOT currently reasonably feasible
2. VA determines the veteran's independence in daily living CAN be improved
3. The gains can reasonably be expected to continue after program completion
4. An IILP has been developed per Sections 21.90 and 21.92
5. The **VR&E Officer concurs** in the IILP (requires higher-level approval)

**Services provided:**

- Recreational and leisure skills training

**Duration:** Maximum 24 months, extendable up to 6 additional months (total 30 months) per Section 21.76.

**Important -- NOT a dead end:** If a veteran's condition improves during or after independent living services, they can be reevaluated for vocational rehabilitation. Independent Living can be a stepping stone to eventual employment.

---

## 32. KEY POINTS FOR YOUR APPOINTMENT

### BEFORE THE APPOINTMENT:

1. **Bring documentation:**
   - VA disability rating letter (showing your percentage and conditions)
   - DD-214 (discharge document)
   - Medical records showing how disability affects work
   - Educational transcripts (high school, college, vocational)
   - Resume or work history
   - Any documentation of failed employment attempts
   - List of medications and their side effects on work capacity

2. **Know your rating:**
   - 20% or higher: You need to show an EMPLOYMENT HANDICAP
   - 10%: You need to show a SERIOUS EMPLOYMENT HANDICAP
   - Know which conditions are service-connected

3. **Have career ideas ready:**
   - What fields interest you?
   - What training would you need?
   - What schools have you researched?
   - The plan is JOINTLY developed -- you have input

4. **Know the Post-9/11 rate option:**
   - If you have Chapter 33 eligibility, you can elect the higher BAH rate
   - Ask about this at the appointment

### DURING THE APPOINTMENT:

5. **Be honest about how your disability affects work.** Do not downplay your limitations. The VRC needs to understand the full impact of your disability to properly evaluate your employment handicap.

6. **The plan is JOINTLY developed (Section 21.92).** You have a right to participate in and agree to all terms. Do NOT let the VRC dictate a plan you disagree with.

7. **You can request a plan change at any time (Section 21.94).** If your initial plan does not work out, it can be changed.

8. **Once inducted, a rating reduction does NOT terminate your eligibility (Section 21.58).** If you are worried about a future C&P exam reducing your rating, know that once you are in the program, a reduction does not kick you out.

9. **Ask about ALL available services:** subsistence allowance, supplies, adaptive equipment, medical treatment, tutoring, transportation, family services.

10. **Ask about travel reimbursement (Section 21.376).** If VA requested you attend the appointment, your travel may be reimbursed.

### KNOW YOUR RIGHTS:

11. **"Rehabilitated" requires 60 days of maintained suitable employment (Section 21.283).** Your case is not closed until you have been employed for 60 days.

12. **Self-employment IS an option (Section 21.257).** If you want to start a business, it is a legitimate vocational goal under VR&E.

13. **Independent Living is available (Sections 21.160-21.162)** if your disabilities are too severe for current employment. Maximum 30 months of services.

14. **Travel to evaluations and counseling is at government expense (Section 21.376).**

15. **Supplies, equipment, and adaptive technology are covered (Sections 21.210-21.224).** This includes computers, software, tools, books, and specialized equipment.

16. **Medical treatment necessary for rehabilitation participation is covered (Section 21.240).** This is in addition to standard VA healthcare.

17. **VA must inform you of all services and your responsibilities BEFORE it can enforce conduct standards (Section 21.362).**

18. **VA cannot discontinue you without going through a three-step process: counseling, interruption, then discontinuation (Section 21.364).** They cannot jump straight to cutting you off.

19. **You can appeal any unfavorable decision (Section 21.416).** Get representation from a VSO if needed.

20. **48 months is the standard cap, but extensions are available** with VR&E Officer concurrence for veterans with serious employment handicaps (Section 21.78).

---

## 33. COMMON DENIAL REASONS AND HOW TO COUNTER

### Denial: "You do not have an employment handicap"

**Counter:** Document in detail how your service-connected disability affects your ability to work. Include:
- Physical limitations (cannot stand, lift, sit for extended periods)
- Cognitive effects (concentration, memory, brain fog from medications)
- Mental health effects (anxiety, PTSD triggers in workplace settings, social difficulties)
- Medication side effects that impair work capacity
- Failed employment attempts with dates and reasons
- Employers who have told you the disability is a problem

### Denial: "A vocational goal is reasonably feasible" (denying Independent Living)

**Counter:** If you believe employment is not currently feasible, provide:
- Medical evidence of severity
- Documentation of failed employment despite best efforts
- Provider opinions on work capacity
- Evidence that your condition prevents sustained employment

### Denial: "The program you want is too long"

**Counter:** Cite Section 21.78 -- extensions beyond 48 months are authorized for veterans with serious employment handicaps. If you have or can establish a SEH, the 48-month cap can be extended with VR&E Officer concurrence.

### Denial: "That school/program is not approved"

**Counter:** Most accredited programs are approved. Ask which specific approval is missing and work with the school's VA certifying official to get it approved. VA has an obligation to help you find approved programs.

### Denial: "Your disability rating is too low"

**Counter:** If you have at least 10%, you are eligible -- but you must demonstrate a SERIOUS employment handicap. Focus on the impact of the disability, not just the percentage. A 10% rating with severe functional limitations can qualify.
