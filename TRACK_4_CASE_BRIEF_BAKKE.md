# TRACK 4 CASE BRIEF: LEVI M. BAKKE
## Why I Qualify for Employment Through Long-Term Services
### VR&E Appointment Preparation Document

**Veteran:** Levi M. Bakke | VA File: 540 02 0275
**Rating:** 100% P&T (PTSD w/ polysubstance use disorder) | Effective: June 28, 2022
**Service:** USMC, Feb 2000 - May 2005 | E-4 Corporal | 0311 Rifleman / 8111 Small Boat Coxswain
**Track Requested:** Track 4 -- Employment Through Long-Term Services (Education)
**Program:** B.S. Accounting -- Fraud & Forensic Accounting Concentration, UMGC (Online)
**Appointment Date:** February 24, 2026 | Duration: 1 Hour

---

## SECTION 1: WHY TRACK 4 -- THE 30-SECOND VERSION

I am a 100% P&T combat veteran who cannot function in traditional employment due to PTSD, chronic panic attacks, and occupational/social impairment in most areas. I have failed in construction, commercial driving, retail, and cell phone repair -- every traditional job. The ONE field where my disabilities become ASSETS is remote fraud investigation. I need a B.S. in Accounting (Fraud & Forensic concentration) from UMGC to legitimize the work I'm already doing and secure gainful employment. Track 4 is the only path that gets me there.

---

## SECTION 2: ELIGIBILITY -- ALREADY ESTABLISHED

### Statutory Basis
- **38 USC 3102(1)(A):** Veteran with honorable discharge + SC disability rating of 20% or more
- **38 CFR 21.40(a):** Basic entitlement requires (1) SC disability, (2) discharge under other than dishonorable, (3) employment handicap

### My Eligibility Is Automatic
| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Honorable Discharge | YES | DD-214: "Honorable" -- Completion of Required Active Service |
| SC Disability 20%+ | YES | 100% P&T (PTSD) effective 6/28/2022 |
| Employment Handicap | YES | VA already rated me with "occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas" |
| Delimiting Date | N/A | Separated 5/31/2005 -- BUT 100% P&T eliminates delimiting date per 38 CFR 21.42 |
| Competent | YES | Rating Decision: "The claimant is considered competent" |

**Key Point:** At 100% P&T, the Employment Handicap finding is virtually automatic per 38 CFR 21.51. The VA has ALREADY documented every element needed.

---

## SECTION 3: SERIOUS EMPLOYMENT HANDICAP (SEH) -- I QUALIFY

### 38 CFR 21.52 Definition
A "serious employment handicap" exists when the veteran has a significant impairment of the ability to prepare for, obtain, or retain employment consistent with abilities, aptitudes, and interests.

### My SEH Evidence (Directly from VA Rating Decision)

The VA has already documented ALL of the following functional limitations:

| VA-Documented Limitation | Impact on Employment |
|---|---|
| Anxiety | Cannot function in high-stress workplace environments |
| Depressed mood | Diminished motivation, energy depletion |
| Difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances | Cannot handle workplace friction, customer complaints, supervisory pressure |
| Difficulty adapting to work | Direct barrier to traditional employment |
| Difficulty establishing/maintaining work relationships | Removed from construction sites for arguing with supervisors |
| Disturbances of motivation and mood | Oscillates between depressive phases and manic phases -- no consistent performance |
| Intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living | Some days cannot leave the house |
| Intermittent inability to maintain minimal personal hygiene | Severity indicator for 100% rating |
| Mild memory loss | Cognitive interference prevents meeting productivity expectations |
| Neglect of personal appearance and hygiene | Severity indicator |
| Occupational/social impairment, deficiencies in most areas | THE HEADLINE: work, school, family, judgment, thinking, mood |
| Panic attacks more than once a week | Physical symptoms (vomiting), cannot drive or perform safety-sensitive tasks |
| Suspiciousness | Difficulty trusting coworkers and supervisors |

### Additional SC Disabilities Compounding Employment Barriers
| Condition | Rating | Employment Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Sleep Apnea | 50% | Fatigue, cannot maintain standard work hours |
| Left Knee | 30% | Cannot perform physical labor, construction, or jobs requiring standing/walking |
| Tinnitus | 10% | Difficulty concentrating in noisy environments |
| **Combined** | **100% P&T** | **Total occupational impairment for traditional work** |

### Employment History Proves SEH

| Job | What Happened | Disability Connection |
|---|---|---|
| Commercial Driver / Construction (2011-2021) | Gave up CDL, left construction | Panic attacks made safety-sensitive work impossible; knee prevented physical labor |
| Cell Phone Repair / CellFix (2021-2022) | Had to reduce from 3-4 days to 1 day/week, then resigned | Could not maintain standard schedule; social stressors triggered symptoms |
| Unemployed (April 2022 - Present) | ~3.5 years unemployed | Every traditional employment attempt has failed |

**The VA's own words from my 28-1902w:** "I am rated as unemployable for standard gainful employment; I surrendered my CDL because panic attacks made safety-sensitive roles impossible."

---

## SECTION 4: WHY TRACK 4 AND NOT ANOTHER TRACK

### Track 1 (Reemployment) -- NOT APPLICABLE
- No previous employer to return to
- Previous occupations (construction, driving) are physically impossible due to knee + dangerous due to panic attacks

### Track 2 (Rapid Access) -- NOT APPLICABLE
- I do NOT have marketable credentials for suitable employment
- High school diploma + 89 quarter hours of construction technology from PCC (2005-2011) = not enough
- No degree, no professional certifications, no credentials for remote analytical work
- Cannot be "rapidly placed" without education

### Track 3 (Self-Employment) -- NOT THE RIGHT FIT NOW
- Valor Investigations LLC exists but is unpaid investigative journalism, not revenue-generating
- Need the DEGREE FIRST to become employable, THEN potentially transition to self-employment
- Education is the prerequisite -- cannot skip it

### Track 5 (Independent Living) -- NOT APPLICABLE
- I AM capable of employment -- in the RIGHT environment with the RIGHT training
- I don't need help with daily living; I need education to access suitable employment

### **TRACK 4 IS THE ONLY OPTION:**
I need a B.S. in Accounting (Fraud & Forensic Accounting) to become employable in the ONE field where my disabilities are actually assets. No other track provides the education I need.

---

## SECTION 5: THE VOCATIONAL GOAL -- WHY IT'S FEASIBLE

### 38 CFR 21.53 -- Feasibility Standard
> "Any reasonable doubt shall be resolved in favor of a finding of feasibility."

### The Goal: Remote Fraud Analyst / Forensic Accountant

| Factor | Evidence |
|---|---|
| **Aptitude** | Already performing fraud investigation work at a professional level (CMS Case #6567616, FBI referrals, 61 billing code manipulation instances identified, Python evidence pipelines) |
| **Interest** | 18+ months of self-directed 60+ hr/week investigative work -- obsessive focus is a disability symptom that SERVES this career |
| **Labor Market** | BLS: Forensic accountants median $79K; fraud analysts $70-100K; growing field, remote-friendly |
| **Disability Accommodation** | This career is IDEAL: remote work, asynchronous, analytical, solitary, self-paced -- every accommodation I need is built into the job |
| **Academic Plan** | UMGC B.S. Accounting, online, asynchronous -- accommodates night-owl schedule, no classroom triggers |
| **Timeline** | 4 terms (Jan 2026 - Aug 2026) with 89 PCC credits transferring |
| **Certification Path** | CFE (Certified Fraud Examiner) immediately after degree -- exam reimbursable by VA |
| **Employment Targets** | Allstate SIU, Aetna, Cigna, Qlarant, Maximus, Guidehouse, Deloitte, CGI Federal, Optum |

### Why My "Impairments" Are Actually Assets in This Field

This is the critical argument. From my 28-1902w Section IX:

| "Impairment" | How It Serves Fraud Investigation |
|---|---|
| Racing thoughts / obsessive focus | Elite at connecting complex data points across thousands of documents |
| Isolation / antisocial tendencies | Thrives in solitary remote analytical work -- no social friction |
| Night-owl schedule (1 AM - 7 PM) | Works when the world is quiet, no social stressors |
| Suspiciousness | ASSET in fraud detection -- sees patterns others miss |
| Hypervigilance | Catches anomalies in data that others overlook |
| Inability to tolerate injustice | The moral injury that drives relentless investigation |

**I succeed in this work BECAUSE of my disability, not in spite of it.**

---

## SECTION 9: REGULATIONS TO CITE IF NEEDED

### If They Question Feasibility
> **38 CFR 21.53:** "Any reasonable doubt shall be resolved in favor of a finding of feasibility."

I have demonstrated aptitude, interest, prior work product, and a clear labor market. Any doubt must be resolved in my favor.

### If They Try a Different Track
> **38 CFR 21.84:** The rehabilitation plan "shall be developed jointly by the veteran and the counselor."

I have the right to participate in plan development. Track 4 is the only track that addresses my barriers.

### If They Say the Degree Isn't Necessary
> **38 USC 3104(a)(1)-(15):** Services include evaluation, counseling, training, education, and "other appropriate services."

The degree is the ONLY barrier between me and employment. I'm already doing the work.

### If They Try to Discontinue or Delay
> **38 CFR 21.362/21.364:** VA must follow a 3-step process before any adverse action.

### If a Previous Decision Was Favorable
> **38 CFR 21.420(e):** Favorable findings are binding on subsequent adjudicators.

## SECTION 10: ONE-PAGE TALKING POINTS (PRINT THIS)

### Opening Statement (60 seconds)
"I'm Levi Bakke, 100% P&T, Marine Corps combat veteran. I'm here because I've spent the last 3.5 years proving I can't work in traditional employment -- but I've also spent 18 months proving I'm exceptional at one thing: fraud investigation. I need a B.S. in Accounting from UMGC to legitimize the work I'm already doing and get hired. I'm requesting Track 4 -- Employment Through Long-Term Services."

### The Three Facts That Matter
1. **I'm 100% P&T with documented occupational impairment in most areas** -- the VA already established I can't work normally
2. **I've already proven aptitude** -- CMS Case #6567616, FBI coordination, published investigations, Python evidence pipelines
3. **I need the degree to get hired** -- the skills exist, the work product exists, but employers require the credential

### If They Push Back
- "I understand Track 4 serves 88% of all VR&E participants. I'm the textbook case for it."
- "Under 38 CFR 21.53, any reasonable doubt about feasibility must be resolved in my favor."
- "I've already done the hardest part -- identifying a career where my disabilities are assets. I just need the degree."

### What NOT to Say
- Don't say you "can't work" -- say your disabilities prevent TRADITIONAL employment but you've found a field where you CAN succeed
- Don't be combative -- the VRC is supposed to be your ally
- Don't lie about your limitations -- your actual documented limitations are MORE than sufficient
- Don't bring up the Bingaman case in detail -- just reference "active federal investigation" as evidence of your work product

### Close
"I'm not asking for anything unusual. I'm asking for exactly what Chapter 31 was designed for -- education that turns a disabled veteran into an employed taxpayer. I have the aptitude, the plan, and the drive. I just need the degree."
