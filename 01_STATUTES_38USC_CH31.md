# 2. SECTION 3100 -- PURPOSES

## Verbatim Statutory Text

> "The purposes of this chapter are to provide for all services and assistance necessary to enable veterans with service-connected disabilities to achieve maximum independence in daily living and, to the maximum extent feasible, to become employable and to obtain and maintain suitable employment."

**Added:** Pub. L. 96-466, title I, Sec. 101(a), October 17, 1980, 94 Stat. 2172
**Renumbered from Sec. 1500:** Pub. L. 102-83, Sec. 5(a), August 6, 1991
**Effective Date:** April 1, 1981

### Why This Section Matters

This is the foundational statement of Congressional intent. Note the TWO purposes of the chapter:
1. **Maximum independence in daily living** (this is the independent living track -- Track 5)
2. **Employability and suitable employment** (this is the vocational rehabilitation tracks -- Tracks 1-4)

The word "necessary" is critical. Congress did not say "reasonable" or "appropriate" -- it said the Secretary must provide ALL services and assistance NECESSARY. This is the broadest possible authorization.

**(3)** The term **"independence in daily living"** means the ability of a veteran, without the services of others or with a reduced level of the services of others, to live and function within such veteran's family and community.

**(4)** The term **"program of education"** has the meaning provided in section 3452(b) of this title.

**(5)** The term **"program of independent living services and assistance"** includes (A) the services provided for in this chapter that are needed to enable a veteran to achieve independence in daily living, including such counseling, diagnostic, medical, social, psychological, and educational services as are determined by the Secretary to be needed for such veteran to achieve maximum independence in daily living, and (B) the assistance authorized by this chapter for such veteran.

### Critical Definitions to Memorize

| Term | Key Language | Why It Matters |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| Employment Handicap | "impairment, resulting in **substantial part** from a service-connected disability" | Does NOT need to be sole or primary cause |
| Serious Employment Handicap | "**significant** impairment, resulting in substantial part from a service-connected disability rated at **10 percent or more**" | Higher bar: "significant" vs. plain "impairment" |
| Vocational Goal | "gainful employment status consistent with abilities, aptitudes, and interests" | Must be GAINFUL employment, not just any job |
| Suitable Employment | Employment that does not worsen disability, is stable, and aligns with abilities/aptitudes/interests | Cannot be forced into a job that worsens your condition |

# 4. SECTION 3102 -- BASIC ENTITLEMENT / ELIGIBILITY

## Verbatim Statutory Text

### Subsection (a) -- In General

A person shall be entitled to a rehabilitation program under the terms and conditions of this chapter if --

**(1)** the person is --

**(A)(i)** a veteran who has a service-connected disability (i) rated at 20 percent or more which was incurred or aggravated in service on or after September 16, 1940; or (ii) incurred or aggravated in service on or after September 16, 1940, and is hospitalized for a service-connected disability pending discharge from active military, naval, air, or space service; and

**(B)** is determined by the Secretary to be in need of rehabilitation because of an employment handicap; or

**(2)** the person is a veteran who --

**(A)** has a service-connected disability rated at 10 percent which was incurred or aggravated in service on or after September 16, 1940; and

**(B)** is determined by the Secretary to be in need of rehabilitation because of a serious employment handicap.

### Subsection (b) -- Additional Programs After Exhausting Unemployment

A person who has completed a rehabilitation program under this chapter shall be entitled to an additional rehabilitation program under the terms and conditions of this chapter if --

(1) the person is described by subsection (a), and
(2) the person --
(A) has exhausted all rights to regular compensation under the State law or under Federal law with respect to a benefit year;
(B) has no rights to regular compensation with respect to a week;
(C) is not receiving compensation with respect to such week under the unemployment compensation law of Canada; and
(D) begins such additional rehabilitation program within six months of the date of such exhaustion.

No person may receive benefits under this subsection if the person received an application after March 31, 2014.

## ELIGIBILITY ANALYSIS -- THE TWO PATHWAYS

### PATHWAY 1: 20% or Higher Disability Rating (Section 3102(1))

**Requirements:**
- Service-connected disability rated at 20% or more under Chapter 11
- Disability was incurred or aggravated in active service on or after September 16, 1940
- The Secretary determines the veteran needs rehabilitation because of an **employment handicap** (lower bar)

**OR (for pre-discharge):**
- Hospitalized or receiving outpatient care for a service-connected disability pending discharge
- The disability is likely to be compensable at 20% or more

### PATHWAY 2: 10% Disability Rating (Section 3102(2))

**Requirements:**
- Service-connected disability rated at exactly 10%
- Disability was incurred or aggravated in active service on or after September 16, 1940
- The Secretary determines the veteran needs rehabilitation because of a **serious employment handicap** (higher bar)

### THE CRITICAL DISTINCTION

| Rating | What You Must Prove | Threshold |
|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| **20% or more** | Employment Handicap | Lower bar -- impairment resulting in substantial part from SC disability |
| **10%** | SERIOUS Employment Handicap | Higher bar -- SIGNIFICANT impairment resulting in substantial part from SC disability rated 10%+ |
| **0%** | N/A | **NOT ELIGIBLE for Chapter 31** |

### Active Duty Service Members

You may also qualify if:
- You have a 20%+ pre-discharge memorandum rating and are separating soon
- You have a severe illness or injury while on active duty awaiting discharge
- See Section 3102(1)(A)(ii) above

---

# 5. SECTION 3103 -- PERIODS OF ELIGIBILITY / 12-YEAR DELIMITING DATE

## Verbatim Statutory Text

### Subsection (a) -- The Basic 12-Year Rule

> "Except as provided in subsections (b), (c), (d), (e), (g), and (h) a rehabilitation program may not be afforded to a veteran under this chapter after the end of the twelve-year period beginning on the date of such veteran's discharge or release from active military, naval, air, or space service."

### Subsection (b) -- Tolling (Clock-Stopping) Exceptions

**(b)(1) -- Medical Condition:** When a veteran was prevented from participating in a vocational rehabilitation program by reason of a medical condition, the 12-year period of eligibility "shall not run during the period of such prevention."

**(b)(2) -- Discharge Status Issues:** The period shall not run during any period when:
- The veteran's discharge status was initially unacceptable but was later changed or the character of discharge was later determined acceptable by the Secretary; OR
- A discharge was initially a bar to benefits under section 5303 but was later determined not to be

**(b)(3) -- Disability Rating Not Yet Established:** The period shall not run during any period when the veteran had not yet established the existence of a service-connected disability rated at 10 percent or more.

### Subsection (c) -- Serious Employment Handicap Extension

Veterans may receive vocational rehabilitation AFTER the 12-year period expires if the Secretary determines services are needed to overcome a **serious employment handicap** AND:

(1) The veteran has not been previously rehabilitated to the point of employability; OR
(2) The veteran was previously rehabilitated but:
(A) the service-connected disability has worsened to the point where the veteran can no longer perform the duties of the previously trained occupation; OR
(B) the occupation for which the veteran was rehabilitated is not suitable given the veteran's current abilities, aptitudes, and employment handicap; OR
(3) The Secretary determines, on the basis of regulations, that an extended period of eligibility is necessary.

### Subsection (d) -- Severe Disability / Independent Living Extension

Veterans with disabilities so severe that a vocational goal is not reasonably feasible may receive **independent living services and assistance** after the 12-year period expires if the Secretary determines an extension is necessary for the veteran to achieve maximum independence in daily living.

### Subsection (e) -- Section 3102(b) Programs Exempt

> The 12-year limitation "shall not apply to a rehabilitation program under section 3102(b) of this title."

### Subsection (f) -- Active Duty Callup

When a veteran is called to active duty under sections 688, 12301(a), 12301(d), 12301(g), 12302, 12304, 12304a, or 12304b of title 10, the eligibility period "shall not run for the period of such active duty service plus four months."

### Subsection (g) -- THE GAME-CHANGER: Post-2013 Veterans

> "The twelve-year period of eligibility established by subsection (a) **shall not apply** to a veteran who was discharged or released from active military, naval, or air service **on or after January 1, 2013.**"

**BOTTOM LINE: If you separated from active duty on or after January 1, 2013, the 12-year delimiting date does NOT apply to you. You are eligible indefinitely, as long as you meet the disability rating and employment handicap requirements.**

### Subsection (h) -- Emergency Situations

**(h)(1) -- Covered Reasons:** When veterans are prevented from participating due to a "covered reason," the period does not run during the prevention. The clock restarts on a date determined by the Secretary, "not earlier than the first day after the veteran is able to resume participation" and "not later than 90 days after that day."

Covered reasons include:
(A) Temporary or permanent closure of an educational institution by reason of an emergency situation; or
(B) Another reason that prevents participation, as determined by the Secretary.

**(h)(2) -- Emergency Situation:** When prevented from participating due to an emergency situation, the 12-year period does not run during prevention and restarts on the first day after the individual can resume participation.

## SUMMARY TABLE: ALL EXCEPTIONS TO THE 12-YEAR RULE

| Exception | Source | Effect |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Medical condition prevented participation | 3103(b)(1) | Clock STOPS during prevention |

> "A rehabilitation program (including individual courses) to be pursued by a veteran shall be subject to the approval of the Secretary. To the maximum extent practicable, a course of education or training may be pursued by a veteran as part of a rehabilitation program under this chapter only if the course is approved for purposes of chapter 30 or 33 of this title. The Secretary may waive the requirement under the preceding sentence to the extent the Secretary determines appropriate."

### Subsection (c) -- Prioritization Authority

## Verbatim Statutory Text

### Subsection (a) -- Extended Evaluation Period

> "The period of extended evaluation under section 3106(c) of this title may not exceed twelve months, except that such period may be extended for additional periods of up to six months each if the Secretary determines, on the basis of the evaluation, that the veteran has a serious employment handicap and there is a substantial likelihood the veteran can benefit from a program of services."

### Subsection (b) -- Vocational Rehabilitation Program Duration

**(b)(1)** The period of a vocational rehabilitation program for a veteran under this chapter following a determination of the current reasonable feasibility of achieving a vocational goal "may not exceed forty-eight months, except that the counseling and placement and postplacement services described in section 3104(a)(2) and (5) of this title may be provided for an additional period not to exceed eighteen months."

**(b)(2)** A rehabilitation program under section 3102(b) "may not exceed 12 months."

**(b)(3)** Emergency extensions: when prevented from participating due to emergencies, the Secretary extends timelines by the number of months missed.

### Subsection (c) -- Extensions for Prior Rehabilitation

The Secretary may extend program duration if the veteran was previously rehabilitated but:

(1) The service-connected disability has worsened so that the veteran cannot perform the duties of the occupation for which rehabilitated, or the occupation is not suitable in view of the veteran's abilities and employment handicap; and
(2) Has a serious employment handicap requiring extension under the Secretary's regulations.

### Subsection (d) -- Independent Living Duration

(1) The period of a program of independent living services and assistance "may not exceed twenty-four months."

(2) The Secretary may extend the period beyond 24 months if the Secretary determines that a longer period is necessary and likely to result in a substantial increase in independence, or the veteran is a post-9/11 Global Operations veteran with severe disability.

### Subsection (e) -- Active Duty Entitlement

Subsistence allowances paid while the veteran serves active duty orders under specified title 10 sections "shall not -- (A) be charged against any entitlement to any subsistence allowance, or (B) be counted toward the aggregate period for which section 3695 of this title limits an individual's receipt of allowance or assistance."

---

# 8. SECTION 3106 -- INITIAL AND EXTENDED EVALUATIONS

## Verbatim Statutory Text

### Subsection (a) -- Initial Evaluation Required

> "The Secretary shall provide any veteran with a service-connected disability rated at 10 percent or more who applies for benefits under this chapter with an initial evaluation consisting of such services described in section 3104(a)(1) of this title as are necessary (1) to determine whether such veteran is entitled to benefits under this chapter, and (2) in the case of a veteran who is determined to be entitled to such benefits, to determine -- (A) whether such veteran has a serious employment handicap, and (B) whether the achievement of a vocational goal currently is reasonably feasible for such veteran."

### Subsection (b) -- Serious Employment Handicap + Feasible Goal

When a veteran has a serious employment handicap AND a vocational goal is reasonably feasible, the veteran receives "an individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation developed under section 3107(a) of this title."

### Subsection (c) -- Extended Evaluation

> If a serious employment handicap exists but feasibility "cannot be determined" initially, the veteran receives "such services under this chapter as the Secretary determines necessary to improve such veteran's potential for participation in a program of services designed to achieve a vocational goal and enable such veteran to achieve maximum independence in daily living."

### Subsection (d) -- Infeasible Vocational Goal

When vocational goals prove infeasible after evaluation, the Secretary determines "whether such veteran is able to achieve maximum independence in daily living through a program of independent living services and assistance under section 3120 of this title."

### Subsection (e) -- THE BENEFIT-OF-THE-DOUBT PROVISION (CRITICAL)

> "The Secretary shall determine as **expeditiously** as possible whether the achievement of a vocational goal by a veteran currently is reasonably feasible. In the case of a veteran provided extended evaluation under subsection (c), the Secretary shall determine whether the achievement of a vocational goal by such veteran currently is reasonably feasible **prior to the expiration of the period of such extended evaluation**. Any reasonable doubt with respect to **feasibility shall be resolved in favor of determining that achievement of a vocational goal currently is reasonably feasible.**"

**THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PROVISIONS IN THE ENTIRE CHAPTER.** The statute REQUIRES the VA to give you the benefit of the doubt on whether a vocational goal is achievable. If they are denying you based on feasibility, cite this section.

### Subsection (f) -- Case Management

> "In the case of each veteran for whom a vocational rehabilitation program is, or is to be, provided under this chapter, the Secretary shall assign a Department of Veterans Affairs employee to be responsible for the management and followup of the program of such veteran."

---

# 9. SECTION 3107 -- INDIVIDUALIZED WRITTEN REHABILITATION PLAN / IWRP

## Verbatim Statutory Text

### Subsection (a) -- Required Contents

> "The Secretary shall formulate an individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation for a veteran described in section 3106(b) of this title. Such plan shall be developed with such veteran and shall include --"

**(1)** A statement of long-range rehabilitation goals for such veteran and intermediate rehabilitation objectives related to achieving such goals;

**(2)** A statement of the specific services (which shall include counseling in all cases) and assistance to be provided under this chapter;

**(3)** The projected date for the initiation and the anticipated duration of each such service; and

**(4)** Objective criteria and an evaluation procedure and schedule for determining whether such objectives and goals are being achieved.

### Subsection (b) -- Annual Reviews

> "The Secretary shall review at least annually the plan formulated under subsection (a) for a veteran and shall afford such veteran the opportunity to participate in each such review. On the basis of each such review, the Secretary shall (1) redevelop such plan with such veteran if the Secretary determines, under regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe, that redevelopment of such plan is appropriate, or (2) disapprove redevelopment of such plan if the Secretary determines, under such regulations, that redevelopment of such plan is not appropriate."

### Subsection (c) -- Dispute Process

**(c)(1):** Each veteran for whom a plan has been developed or for whom redevelopment has been disapproved shall be informed of the opportunity for review.

**(c)(2):** A veteran who does not agree with the plan, redeveloped plan, or disapproval of redevelopment "may submit to the person described in section 3106(f) of this title a written statement containing such veteran's objections and request a review of such plan or disapproval."

**(c)(3):** The Secretary shall review the statement and plan and render a decision "not later than ninety days after the date on which such statement is received." The Secretary may extend this to **150 days** under prescribed regulations.

### PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS

- The plan is developed **WITH you**, not **FOR you** -- you are a collaborative partner
- Counseling is MANDATORY in every plan (subsection (a)(2))
- Every plan must have measurable criteria -- if your plan has no metrics, it is deficient
- You get annual reviews and you have the RIGHT to participate
- If you disagree, you can object IN WRITING and get a response within 90-150 days
- This is a separate dispute process from the AMA appeal lanes

# 10. SECTION 3108 -- ALLOWANCES / SUBSISTENCE

## Summary of Key Provisions

### Who Gets Subsistence Allowance

- Veterans receive a monthly subsistence allowance during rehabilitation program participation
- **EXCEPTION:** During initial evaluations under section 3106(a) or counseling-only services under section 3104(a)(2), subsistence is NOT paid
- Veterans deemed "rehabilitated to the point of employability" receive the full-time training rate for **2 months** while pursuing employment

### Statutory Rate Structure

The statute establishes base monthly rates by training type and dependent status. These are organized as follows:
- **Institutional Training** (college, vocational school, etc.): full-time, 3/4 time, 1/2 time
- **On-Job Training, Farm Cooperative, Apprenticeship**: full-time only
- **Nonpay/Nominal Pay On-Job Training**: full-time only
- **Independent Instructor Training**: full-time only
- **Combined Training**: rate depends on dominant training type

Rates are adjusted annually by CPI. See Section 31 below for current FY2026 rate tables.

### Cost-of-Living Adjustment

> "With respect to the fiscal year beginning on October 1, 1994, the Secretary shall provide a percentage increase in the monthly rates payable under paragraph (1) of this subsection equal to the percentage by which the Consumer Price Index...exceeds such Consumer Price Index" for the prior 12-month period.

This CPI adjustment applies every fiscal year (October 1).

### GI Bill Election Option

Veterans with remaining Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33) eligibility may **elect** to receive the Chapter 33 allowance rate (BAH) instead of the standard Chapter 31 rate. This is done through VA Form 28-0987. See Section 32 below for full details.

### Restrictions on Subsistence Allowance

**(d) Incarcerated Felons:** Veterans who are convicted felons and are residing in a Federal, State, local, or contract prison or jail as the result of a felony shall not be paid subsistence allowance. EXCEPTION: Veterans in halfway houses or participating in work-release programs ARE eligible.

**(e) VA Hospital Treatment:** When receiving VA hospital treatment compensation simultaneously, total payments cannot exceed specified limits.

**(f) On-Job Training Earnings Offset:** Earnings from on-job training reduce allowances proportionally. The allowance plus training wages cannot exceed the journeyman wage for the occupation.

---

# 11. SECTION 3109 -- ENTITLEMENT TO INDEPENDENT LIVING

## Verbatim Statutory Text

> "In any case in which the Secretary has determined under section 3106(e) of this title that the achievement of a vocational goal by a veteran currently is not reasonably feasible, such veteran shall be entitled, in accordance with the provisions of section 3120 of this title, to a program of independent living services and assistance designed to enable such veteran to achieve maximum independence in daily living."

Note the word "entitled" -- this is not discretionary. If the Secretary determines vocational feasibility is not currently achievable, the veteran IS ENTITLED to independent living services.

---

# 12. SECTION 3110 -- LEAVES OF ABSENCE

## Verbatim Statutory Text

> "The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as the Secretary determines necessary for granting leaves of absence to veterans pursuing rehabilitation programs under this chapter. During authorized leaves of absence, a veteran shall be considered to be pursuing such program."

**Key Point:** While on authorized leave, you are still considered to be actively pursuing your rehabilitation program. This means your benefits status is maintained, though your entitlement clock does continue running (you are "pursuing" the program).

---

# 13. SECTION 3111 -- CONDUCT AND COOPERATION

## Verbatim Statutory Text

### Subsection (a) -- Rules and Regulations

> "The Secretary shall prescribe such rules and regulations as the Secretary determines necessary to promote satisfactory conduct and cooperation on the part of veterans who are pursuing rehabilitation programs under this chapter."

### Subsection (b) -- Discontinuation of Services

In any case in which the Secretary determines that a veteran has failed to maintain satisfactory conduct or cooperation, the Secretary may, after determining that all reasonable counseling efforts have been made and are not reasonably likely to be effective, discontinue services and assistance "unless the Secretary determines that mitigating circumstances exist."

### Subsection (c) -- Reinstatement

Services may only be reinstituted if the Secretary determines:

**(1)** "the cause of the unsatisfactory conduct or cooperation of such veteran has been removed"; and

**(2)** "the rehabilitation program which such veteran proposes to pursue (whether the same or revised) is suitable to such veteran's abilities, aptitudes, and interests."

### PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS

- VA cannot just cut you off -- they must first make "all reasonable counseling efforts"
- Even after counseling efforts fail, VA must consider "mitigating circumstances"
- If you are discontinued, you can be reinstated by showing: (1) the cause is removed, and (2) your program is suitable
- Medical conditions, family emergencies, and disability flare-ups can constitute mitigating circumstances
- Document everything -- if VA tries to discontinue your services, this section is your defense

---

# 14. SECTION 3112 -- REVOLVING FUND LOANS

## Verbatim Statutory Text

> "The revolving fund established pursuant to part VII of Veterans Regulation Numbered 1(a) is continued in effect, and may be used by the Secretary, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, for making advances, not in excess of twice the amount of the full-time institutional monthly subsistence allowance for a veteran with no dependents (as provided in section 3108(b) of this title) to veterans pursuing rehabilitation programs under this chapter."

> Such advances "shall bear no interest and shall be repaid in such installments, as may be determined by the Secretary, by proper deductions from future payments of compensation, pension, subsistence allowance, educational assistance allowance, or retirement pay."

### Current Maximum Advance (FY2026)

2 x $812.84 (full-time institutional, no dependents) = **$1,625.68** maximum advance

### Key Features
- **No interest charged** on the advance
- Repaid through deductions from future VA payments
- Available to veterans pursuing rehabilitation programs under Chapter 31
- Emergency financial assistance for veterans in training

---

# 15. SECTION 3113 -- VOCATIONAL REHAB FOR HOSPITALIZED MEMBERS

## Verbatim Statutory Text

**(a)** "Services and assistance may be provided under this chapter to a person described in subparagraphs (A)(ii) and (B) of section 3102(1) of this title who is hospitalized pending discharge from active military, naval, air, or space service. In such cases, no subsistence allowance shall be paid."

**(b)** "Services and assistance may be provided under this chapter to a veteran who is receiving care in a Department of Veterans Affairs hospital, nursing home, or domiciliary facility or in any other hospital or medical facility."

### Key Points
- Pre-discharge servicemembers CAN receive Chapter 31 services while still hospitalized
- But they do NOT receive subsistence allowance in that status
- Veterans in ANY hospital, nursing home, or medical facility can receive services

---

# 16. SECTION 3114 -- VOCATIONAL REHAB OUTSIDE THE US

## Verbatim Statutory Text

> "Under regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe, a vocational rehabilitation program under this chapter may be provided outside the United States if the Secretary determines that such training is (1) necessary in the particular case to provide the preparation needed to render a veteran employable and enable such veteran to obtain and retain suitable employment, and (2) in the best interest of such veteran and the Federal Government."

---

# 17. SECTION 3115 -- REHABILITATION RESOURCES

## Summary

**(a)** The Secretary may use facilities of Federal, State, and local government agencies and federally recognized Indian tribes for training or work experience, without pay or at nominal pay. The Secretary may also employ additional personnel and use resources from public, private, and individual sources.

**(b)** Veterans in on-job training at Federal agencies are considered Federal employees for workers' compensation purposes (Chapter 81, Title 5). Hospital care must generally be in VA facilities. State/local facilities require contracts or cooperative arrangements.

**(c)** Defines "federally recognized Indian tribe" as any Indian tribe, band, nation, pueblo, or organized group recognized by the Secretary of the Interior as eligible for special U.S. programs and services, including Alaska Native villages and regional corporations.

---

# 18. SECTION 3116 -- PROMOTION OF EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES

## Summary

**(a)** The Secretary must actively promote employment, training, and related service opportunities for:
1. Veterans in rehabilitation programs under this chapter
2. Veterans with service-connected disabilities
3. Other veterans covered by Chapter 42 employment provisions

This is done through VA staff outreach to employers and coordination with Federal, State, local agencies, and nongovernmental organizations.

**(b)(1)** The Secretary may compensate employers who provide on-job training to veterans in rehabilitation programs. Payment cannot exceed the employer's direct expenses for providing training or employment opportunities.

**(b)(2)** Veterans in OJT meeting criteria for training assistance under section 3687 receive that allowance to the extent of remaining eligibility.

**(b)(3)** Regulations are prescribed in consultation with the Secretary of Labor, considering the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and section 4212 implementing regulations.

---

# 19. SECTION 3117 -- EMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE

## Verbatim Statutory Text

### Subsection (a) -- Employment Assistance

**(a)(1)** A veteran with a service-connected disability rated at 10 percent or more who has participated in a vocational rehabilitation program under this chapter or a similar program under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and who the Secretary has determined to be employable "shall be furnished assistance in obtaining employment consistent with such veteran's abilities, aptitudes, interests, and employment handicap, including assistance necessary to insure that such veteran receives the benefit of any applicable provisions of law or regulation providing for special consideration or emphasis or preference for such veteran in employment or training."

**(a)(2)** Assistance may include:
(A) Direct placement in employment;
(B) Employment, training, and placement services under Chapter 41;
(C) Job development and placement services from:
(i) Rehabilitation Act programs,
(ii) State employment service and Veterans' Employment Service of DOL,
(iii) Office of Personnel Management,
(iv) Any other public or nonprofit organization, and
(v) For-profit entities when necessary and comparable services unavailable elsewhere.

### Subsection (b) -- Self-Employment Assistance

**(b)(1)** When a veteran has completed a vocational rehabilitation program for self-employment in a small business, the Secretary shall:
- Assist in securing a loan under Chapter 37 subchapter IV
- Cooperate with the Small Business Administration to help secure equipment financing
- Ensure the veteran receives special SBA consideration under section 4(b)(1) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 633(b)(1))

**(b)(2)** For veterans trained under a State rehabilitation program for small business self-employment, the Secretary may provide supplementary equipment, initial stocks, and supplies when not available through the State program or other sources, subject to cost limitations in section 3104(a)(12).

---

# 20. SECTION 3118 -- PERSONNEL TRAINING, DEVELOPMENT, AND QUALIFICATIONS

## Summary

**(a)** The Secretary must maintain an ongoing program of professional training and development for VA rehabilitation staff.

**(b)** Coordination required with the Commissioner of the Rehabilitation Services Administration (Department of Education) and the Assistant Secretary for Veterans' Employment and Training (Department of Labor).

**(c)** The Secretary must establish qualifications for rehabilitation personnel, considering professional standards under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.

---

# 21. SECTION 3119 -- REHABILITATION RESEARCH AND SPECIAL PROJECTS

## Summary

**(a)** The Secretary shall carry out an ongoing program of research and special projects to advance rehabilitation knowledge, methods, and resources.

**(b)** Authority to make grants or contracts with public or nonprofit agencies, including institutions of higher learning.

**(c)** Cooperation with the Commissioner of the Rehabilitation Services Administration, the Director of the Institute of Handicapped Research, and the Secretaries of Labor and Health and Human Services.

---

# 22. SECTION 3120 -- PROGRAM OF INDEPENDENT LIVING SERVICES AND ASSISTANCE

## Verbatim Statutory Text

### Subsection (a) -- Delivery

The Secretary may, as the Secretary determines appropriate, contract with entities described in subsection (f), or may use facilities of the Veterans Health Administration that have demonstrated expertise in providing programs of independent living services and assistance.

### Subsection (b) -- Who Qualifies

Independent living programs shall be made available only to a veteran who:
- Has "a serious employment handicap resulting in substantial part from a service-connected disability described in section 3102(1)(A)(i) of this title"
- For whom "the achievement of a vocational goal currently is not reasonably feasible" under section 3106(d) or (e)

### Subsection (c) -- Long-Term Care Priority

> "The Secretary shall, to the maximum extent feasible, include among the veterans who are provided with programs of independent living services and assistance under this section veterans who are receiving long-term care in facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs, in nursing homes under contract with the Department, or in other situations in which the Secretary determines that the provision of such services would be beneficial."

### Subsection (d) -- Services Provided

Programs consist of services from section 3104(a) "as the Secretary determines necessary to enable such veteran to achieve maximum independence in daily living." Veterans receive "an individualized written plan of services and assistance" similar to those provided under section 3107.

### Subsection (e) -- Annual Cap

**(e)(1)** In each fiscal year, "the number of veterans who are new participants in programs of independent living services and assistance under this section may not exceed 2,700."

**(e)(2)** The 2,700-veteran limitation "shall not apply in the case of a veteran who -- (A) was displaced as the result of, or otherwise adversely affected by, a natural or other disaster, as determined by the Secretary; and (B) is at risk of becoming homeless as a result of the natural or other disaster."

Priority goes to veterans whose vocational infeasibility is due solely to their service-connected disability.

### Subsection (f) -- Eligible Providers

Public or nonprofit agencies providing services for handicapped individuals, or for-profit entities when comparable services are not available or cannot be obtained cost-effectively from public/nonprofit sources or VHA.

---

# 23. SECTION 3121 -- VETERANS' ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON REHABILITATION

# 25. 38 CFR 21.51 -- EMPLOYMENT HANDICAP

## Verbatim Regulatory Text

> "For the purposes of Sec. 21.50, an employment handicap will be found to exist only if a CP or VRC determines that the individual meets each of the following conditions:"

### (a) Vocational Impairment

> "The individual has a vocational impairment; that is, an impairment of the ability to prepare for, obtain, or keep employment in an occupation consistent with his or her abilities, aptitudes, and interests."

### (b) Effects of Impairment Not Overcome

> "The individual has not overcome the effects of the individual's impairment of employability through employment in, or qualifying for employment in, an occupation consistent with his or her abilities, aptitudes, and interests. This situation includes an individual who qualifies for a suitable job, but who does not obtain or keep the job for reasons beyond his or her control."

### (c) Contribution of Service-Connected Disability

> "(1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the service-connected disability(ies) must contribute in substantial part to the individual's overall vocational impairment...but need not be the sole or primary cause of the employment handicap."

> "(2) When determining the individual's overall vocational impairment, the CP or VRC will consider the factors identified in Sec. 21.50(c)."

> "(3) For determinations made on applications for vocational rehabilitation filed on or after March 30, 1995, but before October 9, 1996, the individual's service-connected disability(ies) need not contribute..."

### PRACTICAL INTERPRETATION

**The three-part test for Employment Handicap:**
1. You have vocational impairment (difficulty preparing for, getting, or keeping a suitable job)
2. You have not overcome the impairment (you are not already in suitable employment)
3. Your service-connected disability contributes in SUBSTANTIAL PART to the impairment (but does NOT need to be the sole or primary cause)

**The "substantial part" standard is veteran-friendly.** It requires an "identifiable, measurable, or observable causative effect" -- not dominance. If your SC disability contributes meaningfully to your employment difficulties, that is enough.

---

# 26. 38 CFR 21.52 -- SERIOUS EMPLOYMENT HANDICAP

## Verbatim Regulatory Text

### (a) Requirements

For an individual found to have an employment handicap, a CP or VRC must separately determine whether they have a serious employment handicap:

**(1) Significant Vocational Impairment:** "The individual has a significant impairment of the ability to prepare for, obtain, or keep employment in an occupation consistent with his or her abilities, aptitudes, and interests."

**(2) Effects Not Overcome:** Same as employment handicap test -- effects not overcome through current employment.

**(3) Service-Connected Disability Contribution:**
(i) The service-connected disability(ies) must contribute substantially, having "an identifiable, measurable, or observable causative effect" but need not be sole or primary cause.
(ii) Special rule for applications filed March 30, 1995 through October 9, 1996.

### (b) Assessment Factors

VA will develop and assess the following factors:

1. Number of disabling conditions
2. Severity of each condition
3. Whether a neuropsychiatric condition exists
4. Adequacy of education and training
5. Periods of unemployment or underemployment
6. Reliance on government support patterns
7. Complexity of service and assistance needed
8. Employment restrictions from disability discrimination, substance abuse, labor market conditions
9. Other relevant employment-related factors

### Presumptive Standards (from 38 CFR 21.52(c)-(d))

**Normally NOT found:** A finding of serious employment handicap is normally NOT made when the service-connected disability is rated at less than 30%.

**HOWEVER -- Mandatory findings of SEH:**

A veteran found to have an employment handicap **SHALL ALSO BE HELD** to have a serious employment handicap if:
- They have a **neuropsychiatric** service-connected disability rated at **30% or more**; OR
- They have **any other** service-connected disability rated at **50% or more**

### PRACTICAL IMPACT TABLE

| SC Rating | Employment Handicap (EH) | Serious Employment Handicap (SEH) |
|-----------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 10% | Must prove EH to qualify | MUST prove SEH -- only pathway at 10% |
| 20% | Must prove EH (lower bar) | Not required for entry, but helpful for extensions |
| 30% (non-psych) | Lower bar | Normally not presumed, but CAN be proven with evidence |
| 30%+ (psych) | Lower bar | **PRESUMED AUTOMATICALLY** |
| 40% (non-psych) | Lower bar | Normally not presumed, but can be proven |
| 50%+ (any) | Lower bar | **PRESUMED AUTOMATICALLY** |

### WHY THIS MATTERS

Serious Employment Handicap (SEH) unlocks:
- Eligibility for veterans with only 10% SC rating
- Extensions beyond the 12-year delimiting date (Section 3103(c))
- Extensions beyond the 48-month program limit (38 CFR 21.78(c))
- Case management assignment (Section 3106(f))
- Extended evaluation services (Section 3106(c))
- Certain priority considerations (Section 3104(c))

If your SC rating is 30%+ psych or 50%+ anything, SEH is PRESUMED. You should ensure your VRC documents this.

---

# 27. 38 CFR 21.78 -- EXTENDING BEYOND 48 MONTHS

## Verbatim Regulatory Text

### (a) General Rule

> "Neither the basic period of entitlement which may be authorized for a program of rehabilitation under Chapter 31 alone, nor a combination of entitlement of Chapter 31 and other programs listed in Sec. 21.4020 shall exceed 48 months except as indicated in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section."

### (b) Employment Handicap Extensions

Extensions beyond 48 months for veterans with an employment handicap:

**(1)** Previously completed training but SC disability worsened, preventing performance of trained occupation duties. Additional training in same or different field may be authorized.

**(2)** Previously trained occupation becomes unsuitable due to veteran's abilities and employment handicap.

**(3)** Previously used education benefits under other VA programs, and additional Chapter 31 assistance is needed for employability (combined total exceeds 48 months, though Chapter 31 alone cannot exceed 48 under this provision).

**(4)** Veteran elected Chapter 30 educational assistance rates under an approved Chapter 31 program, with specific limitations.

**(5)** Assistance exceeding 48 months consists solely of employment assistance.

### (c) Serious Employment Handicap Extensions

Duration may extend beyond 48 months to:

**(1)** Enable completion of rehabilitation to employability.

**(2)** Provide extended evaluation when combined evaluation and rehabilitation would exceed 48 months.

**(3)** Provide independent living services, including cases where vocational goals become feasible during or after such services.

**(4)** Following achievement of employability:
(i) Veteran unable to secure employment despite intensive efforts, requiring retraining;
(ii) Developed skills no longer adequate for employment in the field, requiring retraining;
(iii) Worsened SC disability prevents performing trained occupation duties, requiring new training;
(iv) Previously trained occupation unsuitable due to veteran's abilities and employment handicap.

**(5)** Assistance exceeding 48 months consists solely of employment assistance.

### (d) Approval Required

All extensions beyond 48 months require:
- Approval of a Counseling Psychologist (CP) or Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC)
- Concurrence of the Veteran Readiness and Employment Officer or designee

Concurrence is NOT required when the extension consists solely of employment assistance.

---

# 28. EMPLOYMENT HANDICAP VS. SERIOUS EMPLOYMENT HANDICAP -- PRACTICAL ANALYSIS

Understanding the distinction between these two concepts is the single most important practical knowledge for your VR&E appointment. It affects everything.

## Side-by-Side Comparison

| Factor | Employment Handicap (EH) | Serious Employment Handicap (SEH) |
|--------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Statutory Definition** | "An impairment" of ability | "A SIGNIFICANT impairment" of ability |
| **SC Disability Required** | 20%+ for entry via Pathway 1 | 10%+ for entry via Pathway 2 |
| **Contribution Test** | Substantial part (not sole/primary) | Substantial part (not sole/primary) |
| **Factors Assessed** | General vocational impairment | 9 specific factors under 21.52(b) |
| **Presumption at 30%+ psych** | N/A (already qualifies) | PRESUMED |
| **Presumption at 50%+ any** | N/A (already qualifies) | PRESUMED |
| **Normally NOT found below** | N/A | Below 30% |
| **12-year extension** | No | YES (Section 3103(c)) |
| **Beyond 48 months** | Limited (21.78(b)) | Broad (21.78(c)) |
| **Case manager assigned** | No requirement | Required (Section 3106(f)) |

## What Each Finding Unlocks

### Employment Handicap Only (no SEH finding)
- Basic program entry (for 20%+ veterans)
- Up to 48 months of training
- Plus 18 months of counseling/placement
- Subject to 12-year delimiting date (unless post-2013 veteran)

### Serious Employment Handicap (SEH)
- Program entry even at 10% rating
- Extensions beyond 12-year delimiting date
- Extensions beyond 48 months of training
- Extended evaluation services
- Assigned case manager
- Independent living eligibility (if vocational goal infeasible)
- Priority consideration for certain services

### HOW TO ARGUE FOR SEH

Focus on the 9 factors in 38 CFR 21.52(b):
1. **Multiple conditions** -- list every disabling condition, not just your highest-rated one
2. **Severity** -- describe functional limitations in specific terms
3. **Neuropsychiatric** -- PTSD, TBI, depression, anxiety are all neuropsychiatric; if rated 30%+, SEH is presumed
4. **Education gaps** -- describe how your disability has prevented education or made past education obsolete
5. **Unemployment/underemployment** -- document your work history and how disability has caused gaps
6. **Government support** -- document any reliance on VA compensation, SSDI, food assistance, etc.
7. **Complex needs** -- describe the multiple types of services you need
8. **Discrimination/barriers** -- describe any employment discrimination you have experienced due to disability
9. **Other factors** -- anything else relevant to your employment difficulties

---

# 29. THE FIVE VR&E SERVICE TRACKS

After entitlement is established, your VRC places you on one of five tracks:

## Track 1: REEMPLOYMENT (Return to Work)
- **Purpose:** Help you return to your former job or a similar position
- **For:** Veterans who want to go back to a previous employer
- **Services:** Job accommodations, assistive technology, disability-related workplace adjustments, employer outreach
- **Duration:** Typically shortest track

## Track 2: RAPID ACCESS TO EMPLOYMENT (Job Ready)
- **Purpose:** Help you find a job using skills you already have
- **For:** Veterans who already have marketable skills but need help with the job search
- **Services:** Resume development, job search assistance, interview preparation, job coaching, short-term refresher training
- **Duration:** Weeks to a few months
- **No long-term training needed**

## Track 3: EMPLOYMENT THROUGH LONG-TERM SERVICES (Education/Training)
- **Purpose:** Provide education or training for a new career field
- **For:** Veterans who need retraining because their disability prevents work in their previous field
- **Services:** College degrees (associate through graduate), vocational/technical training, OJT, apprenticeships, certificate programs
- **VA pays:** Tuition, fees, books, supplies, equipment (laptops, tools, etc.), subsistence allowance
- **Duration:** Up to 48 months (can be extended with SEH per 38 CFR 21.78)
- **THIS IS THE TRACK MOST VETERANS THINK OF WHEN THEY HEAR "CHAPTER 31"**

## Track 4: SELF-EMPLOYMENT (Start a Business)
- **Purpose:** Help you start your own business
- **For:** Veterans with service-connected disabilities and employment barriers that make traditional employment difficult
- **Services:** Business plan development, business training, equipment/supplies/materials, SBA loan assistance
- **Cost limits:** Under $25,000 = approved by local VR&E Officer; $25,000+ = approved by Director, VR&E Service (national level)
- **Business plan required**
- **SBA coordination included per Section 3117(b)**

## Track 5: INDEPENDENT LIVING
- **Purpose:** Help you live as independently as possible
- **For:** Veterans whose disabilities are so severe that employment is not currently feasible
- **Services:** Assistive technology, mobility training, community integration, independent living skills, adaptive aids
- **Annual cap:** 2,700 new participants nationally per year
- **Duration:** Maximum 24 months (extensions possible per Section 3105(d))
- **Does NOT require employment as a goal**
- **Home modifications are NOT included** -- those require the SAH grant under section 2102B

### You Can Change Tracks

If your disability worsens, your employment objective changes, or your circumstances change, your IWRP can be redeveloped and your track can change. This is covered by the annual review process under Section 3107(b).

---

# 30. SELF-EMPLOYMENT PROVISIONS

## Combined Statutory and Regulatory Authority

### Statutory Authorization

**Section 3104(a)(12):** VA provides "license fees and essential equipment, supplies, and minimum stocks of materials as the Secretary determines to be necessary for a veteran to begin employment and are within the criteria and cost limitations that the Secretary shall prescribe in regulations."

### Regulatory Implementation (38 CFR / M28R Chapter 9)

**Business Plan Requirement:** A viable business plan must be developed. When using Fast Track planning, the business plan is accomplished under a Fast Track IWRP.

**Cost Thresholds for Approval:**
- **Under $25,000:** May be approved by the local VR&E Officer
- **$25,000 or more:** Must be approved by the **Director, VR&E Service** (national-level approval required)

### Combined Training (Rate depends on dominant training type)

- If institutional training is the dominant component: Use institutional rates
- If on-job training is the dominant component: Use on-job training rates

### Key Facts About Subsistence Allowance

- **Maximum Monthly Rate (FY2026):** $3,439.23
- **Payment Schedule:** Paid monthly IN ARREARS (training in October = payment in early November)
- **CPI Adjustment:** Rates change October 1 each fiscal year
- **NOT taxable income** (VA benefits are tax-exempt under 38 USC 5301)
- **Does NOT count against** VA disability compensation -- you receive BOTH simultaneously

## FY2025 Rates (Prior Year, for Reference)

- Full-Time Institutional, No Dependents: $793.02
- Maximum Monthly Rate (FY2025): $3,355.39

# 32. POST-9/11 GI BILL BAH ELECTION

## How It Works

If you qualify for the Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33), you may **elect** to receive the Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) rate instead of the standard Chapter 31 subsistence allowance rate.

## The Form

File **VA Form 28-0987** -- Election for CH31 Subsistence Allowance (CH31SA) Rate or Post-9/11 Subsistence Allowance (P911SA) Rate.

## Which Rate Is Higher?

- In **medium- and high-cost** areas, the Post-9/11 BAH rate (E-5 with dependents) typically EXCEEDS the standard Chapter 31 rate by a significant margin
- In **low-cost** areas, Chapter 31 rates can sometimes be comparable or even slightly better
- **ALWAYS ask your VRC to show you BOTH amounts in writing before you elect**

### Example Comparison (FY2026)

| Area Type | Ch. 31 Full-Time (no deps) | Post-9/11 BAH Rate | Difference |
|-----------|---------------------------|-------------------|------------|
| High-cost metro (e.g., San Francisco) | $812.84 | ~$3,000+ | BAH wins by $2,200+ |
| Medium-cost metro | $812.84 | ~$1,800-2,200 | BAH wins by $1,000-1,400 |
| Low-cost rural | $812.84 | ~$900-1,100 | BAH wins by modest amount |
| National average | $812.84 | ~$1,500 | BAH wins by ~$700 |

*BAH rates are based on the zip code of the training facility, calculated at the E-5 with dependents rate.*

## Key Details

- The P911SA rate changes **January 1st annually** (tied to BAH)
- The standard Chapter 31 rate changes **October 1st annually** (tied to CPI)
- Your VRC can help you compare rates
- You can only elect one rate at a time
- You can change your election, but check with your VRC on timing

## Critical: Does It Use GI Bill Entitlement?

**NO.** Using Chapter 31 with the BAH rate election does NOT consume your Post-9/11 GI Bill months of entitlement. Chapter 31 has its own entitlement period (up to 48 months). You are electing the PAYMENT RATE, not switching programs.

This means:
- You keep your Post-9/11 GI Bill entitlement intact
- You receive the higher BAH payment rate
- You use Chapter 31 entitlement for the program itself
- This is one of the best-kept secrets in VA benefits

---

# 33. APPEAL RIGHTS AND PROCESS

## If You Are Denied Entitlement or Disagree with Any Decision

Under the **Appeals Modernization Act (AMA)**, effective February 19, 2019, you have three decision review lanes:

### Lane 1: Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995)
- **What:** Provide **new and relevant evidence** not previously considered
- **How:** VA re-reviews the claim with the new evidence
- **Best for:** When you have additional documentation to submit (medical records, employer letters, vocational assessments, etc.)
- **Timeline:** Generally faster than other options

### Lane 2: Higher-Level Review (VA Form 20-0996)
- **What:** A **more senior VA official** reviews the same evidence
- **How:** No new evidence can be submitted
- **Best for:** When you believe the original decision was wrong based on existing facts
- **Reviewed by:** The VR&E Officer, assistant, or supervisor at your Regional Office
- **Includes:** Option for an informal conference (phone call with reviewer)

### Lane 3: Board Appeal (VA Form 10182)
- **What:** Appeal to the **Board of Veterans' Appeals**
- **Three sub-options:**
  - **(A) Direct Review:** Evidence of record only, no new evidence, no hearing
  - **(B) Evidence Submission:** Submit additional evidence within 90 days of filing
  - **(C) Hearing:** Request a hearing and submit additional evidence within 90 days after the hearing
- **Timeline:** Longest option, can take 1-3 years

## Critical Timeline

- **You must file your appeal within ONE YEAR of the decision**
- Filing within one year **preserves your effective date**
- You can **chain decision reviews** (e.g., HLR denied -> Supplemental Claim with new evidence) as long as each is filed within one year of the prior decision
- Missing the one-year window means you start over with a new claim and new effective date

## IWRP-Specific Disputes (Section 3107(c))

For disagreements specifically about your rehabilitation plan (not entitlement):
- Submit **written objections** to the person described in Section 3106(f) (your case manager)
- Request plan review
- The Secretary must render a decision within **90 days** (extendable to **150 days** under regulations)
- This is SEPARATE from the AMA appeal lanes
- You can use BOTH processes if needed

## Practical Advice

1. **Never let a denial stand unchallenged** -- always file within one year
2. **Get everything in writing** -- verbal denials are hard to appeal
3. **Request your C-file** (claims file) if you want to see what VA is looking at
4. **Consider a VSO** (Veterans Service Organization) for help with appeals -- they are free
5. **Accredited attorneys** can also help, typically on contingency for disability claims (but VR&E appeals may not have the same fee structures)

# 34. WHAT TO EXPECT AT YOUR FIRST APPOINTMENT

## Before the Appointment

### Documents to Bring
1. **DD-214** (discharge papers) -- though VA should already have this
2. **VA disability rating decision letter** -- shows your rated conditions and percentages
3. **Current resume** (if you have one)
4. **Medical records** showing how disabilities affect your ability to work
5. **Education transcripts** (high school, college, vocational training, military training)
6. **Employment records** showing job difficulties, terminations, or reduced hours due to disability
7. **Any vocational assessments** you have had done
8. **A written statement** describing how your disabilities impact your employment

### Know Your Vocational Goal Before Walking In
- Do NOT walk in saying "I want to go to school" or "I need help" -- that is too vague
- Be specific: "I want to become a [specific occupation] because [reasons]"
- Have a backup goal in mind
- Research whether your desired occupation is realistic given your disabilities
- Know the education/training requirements for your goal
- Be prepared to explain why this goal aligns with your abilities, aptitudes, and interests

### Prepare to Explain the Disability-Employment Connection
- You MUST articulate how your service-connected disabilities prevent you from obtaining or maintaining suitable employment
- Be specific and concrete: "My back injury rated at 40% prevents me from standing more than 30 minutes, which eliminates my previous 15-year career in construction"
- Address BOTH physical and mental health impacts on work
- Describe failed employment attempts if applicable
- Describe any workplace accommodations you have tried

## During the Appointment

The Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) will:

1. **Conduct an initial evaluation** (required by Section 3106(a)) to determine:
   - Whether you have an employment handicap (or serious employment handicap for 10% veterans)
   - Whether a vocational goal is reasonably feasible

2. **Review your military, medical, educational, and employment history**

3. **Assess your interests, aptitudes, and abilities** (may include standardized vocational testing -- GATB, O*NET, Strong Interest Inventory, etc.)

4. **Discuss your disability's impact on employment** -- how your conditions limit what jobs you can do

5. **Determine your track** (Reemployment, Rapid Access, Long-Term, Self-Employment, or Independent Living)

6. **Begin developing your IWRP** (Individualized Written Rehabilitation Plan) if you are found entitled

## Critical Things to Know Going In

- **The VRC works for VA, not for you** -- be respectful but firm about your needs and your rights
- **Everything must be documented** -- if they say it, get it in writing. If they promise something verbally, ask for it to be noted in your file
- **You have the right to disagree** with the proposed plan (Section 3107(c))
- **Doubts about feasibility must be resolved in YOUR favor** (Section 3106(e)) -- cite this if they question whether your goal is achievable
- **You can request a different counselor** if you have issues (policy matter, not statutory right, but it is done)
- **VA pays for tuition, books, supplies, AND equipment** -- do not let anyone tell you it only covers some costs. Section 3104(a)(7) is explicit.
- **Ask about the Post-9/11 BAH election** (VA Form 28-0987) if you qualify for Chapter 33 -- this can mean hundreds or thousands more per month
- **If denied, you have ONE YEAR to appeal** -- do not let a denial go unchallenged
- **Ask what determination they are making about EH vs. SEH** -- this affects everything downstream
- **The plan is developed WITH you, not FOR you** -- you are a collaborative partner per Section 3107(a)
