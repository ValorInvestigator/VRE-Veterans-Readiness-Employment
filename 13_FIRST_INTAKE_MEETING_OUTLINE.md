# YOUR FIRST VR&E INTAKE MEETING — What's Supposed to Happen

## A Step-by-Step Outline for Veterans

*Know the process. Know your rights. Know when they're cutting corners.*

---

## BEFORE YOU WALK IN

### What Your Counselor Already Did (Or Should Have)

Before you show up, your assigned Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) is required to:

- [ ] Pull and review your **VA claims file** (C-file) — your medical records, disability ratings, service history
- [ ] Review your **VA Form 28-1900** application
- [ ] Note every **service-connected disability** and its rating
- [ ] Check for **prior VR&E participation** and why it ended
- [ ] Flag any **PTSD, TBI, or mental health conditions** requiring accommodations
- [ ] Prepare assessment materials (RNI form, CareerScope login, etc.)

**Reality:** Many counselors admit they don't review your file beforehand. If they're asking you basic questions that are already in your records — that's a red flag.

## PHASE 1: GROUP ORIENTATION (~30-60 minutes)

Most VA offices start with a group session before your one-on-one.

### What Should Happen

1. **Program overview** — What VR&E / Chapter 31 actually is
2. **Five-track explanation:**
   - **Track 1: Reemployment** — back to your old job with accommodations
   - **Track 2: Rapid Access** — you have skills, just need help finding work
   - **Track 3: Self-Employment** — start your own business
   - **Track 4: Long-Term Services** — college, vocational training, certifications
   - **Track 5: Independent Living** — for when work isn't feasible right now
3. **Your rights and responsibilities** explained
4. **Paperwork distributed:**
   - **VA Form 28-1902w** (Rehabilitation Needs Inventory) — ~6 pages of questions about your background, interests, barriers
   - **CareerScope or O*NET Interest Profiler** login credentials
   - Employment Planning Questionnaire
5. **You sign VA Form 28-0800** — acknowledging you received the orientation
6. **Your VRC assignment** — you're told who your counselor is

### What You Fill Out

The **Rehabilitation Needs Inventory (RNI)** asks about:
- Your education and training history
- Your work experience
- What kind of work interests you
- What's stopping you from working
- Daily living challenges
- Medical and mental health status

**Take your time with this.** Everything you write goes into your record and influences their decision.

## PHASE 2: ONE-ON-ONE INITIAL EVALUATION (~1.5-3.5 hours)

This is the real appointment. You and your VRC, in a private room. Per M28R Part II, this must happen in an environment with **auditory and visual privacy** — no open cubicles, no interruptions.

### Step 1: Review Your Paperwork (~15-20 min)

Your VRC reviews your completed RNI (28-1902w) and discusses your answers. They use it as a structured interview tool — going through each section and asking follow-up questions.

**What they should ask:**
- "Tell me more about [your work history / education / barriers]"
- "How do your disabilities affect your daily life?"
- "What happened at your last job?"
- "What kind of work would you like to do?"

### Step 2: Comprehensive Evaluation (~45-90 min)

This is the core of the appointment. Federal law (38 CFR 21.50) requires your VRC to assess **six specific areas:**

#### Area 1: Disability Impact
How your service-connected AND non-service-connected disabilities affect your ability to work and live independently.

**They should ask about:**
- Physical limitations (pain, mobility, stamina, dexterity)
- Mental health impact (concentration, memory, motivation, anxiety, sleep)
- How disabilities affect daily activities (driving, household tasks, self-care)
- Good days vs. bad days
- Current treatment and medications

#### Area 2: Physical and Mental Capabilities
What you CAN do — not just what you can't.

**They should assess:**
- Physical abilities relevant to work (lifting, standing, sitting, etc.)
- Cognitive function (attention, processing speed, memory)
- Communication abilities
- Emotional regulation and stress tolerance

#### Area 3: Vocational Impairment
How your disabilities specifically impact your ability to prepare for, get, and keep a job.

**They should explore:**
- Jobs you've lost or had to leave because of disabilities
- Training you couldn't complete
- Skills that have degraded
- Industries you can no longer work in

#### Area 4: Abilities, Aptitudes, and Interests
What you're good at, what you're drawn to, what you could succeed in.

**They should review:**
- Your CareerScope / O*NET results
- Past skills and certifications
- Career interests and goals
- Transferable skills from military and civilian work

#### Area 5: Personal History and Circumstances
The full picture of your life situation.

**They should ask about:**
- Education level and quality
- Employment track record
- Family situation (spouse, dependents, support system)
- Housing stability
- Financial situation
- Community involvement
- Adjustment since separation

#### Area 6: Other Employability Factors
External barriers beyond your disabilities.

**They should consider:**
- Local job market for your target career
- Discrimination barriers
- Geographic limitations
- Transportation access
- Childcare needs
- Criminal history (if applicable)
- Age-related factors

### Step 3: Career Discussion (~20-30 min)

This is where the VRC should:
- **Listen to YOUR goals** — what do you want to do?
- **Explore realistic options** that match your abilities, interests, and market demand
- **Discuss all five tracks** and which might fit your situation
- **NOT shoot down your goals** without good reason and documentation
- **NOT steer you to the cheapest option** — the law says "consistent with abilities, aptitudes, and interests," not "cheapest available"

### Step 4: Three Formal Determinations

Based on everything above, your VRC must make three decisions:

#### Determination 1: Do You Have an Employment Handicap (EH)?

**YES if ALL THREE are true:**
1. Your ability to get/keep suitable work is impaired
2. You haven't overcome that impairment through existing employment
3. Your service-connected disabilities contribute "in substantial part" (they don't have to be the main cause — just "an identifiable, measurable, or observable causative effect")

#### Determination 2: Do You Have a Serious Employment Handicap (SEH)?

**A separate, additional finding.** SEH means the impairment is "significant." The VRC evaluates 9 factors including severity, number of conditions, neuropsychiatric involvement, employment patterns, and complexity of needed services.

**Why this matters:** SEH gets you more services, longer timeframes, and eligibility even at 10% rating.

#### Determination 3: Is a Vocational Goal Reasonably Feasible?

**The standard favors you:**
- "Any reasonable doubt shall be resolved in favor of a finding of feasibility" (38 CFR 21.53)
- To deny you, they need "compelling evidence which establishes infeasibility beyond any reasonable doubt"
- If they can't decide, they MUST provide an extended evaluation (up to 12 months of services while they figure it out)

### Step 5: Track Placement

If you're found entitled, the VRC tells you which track they recommend:

| Track | You Need... | Time Frame |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **Reemployment** | Your old job back with accommodations | Months |
| **Rapid Access** | Job search help — you already have skills | Months |
| **Self-Employment** | To start a business | 6-24 months |
| **Long-Term Services** | College degree or vocational training | Up to 48 months |
| **Independent Living** | Help with daily living — work isn't feasible yet | Varies |

### Step 6: Begin Your Plan

If entitled, you and the VRC start building your **Individualized Written Rehabilitation Plan (IWRP):**
- Your vocational goal
- What services VA will provide
- Timeline and milestones
- Your responsibilities
- How progress will be measured

**This is collaborative.** The VRC develops it WITH you, not FOR you.

## PHASE 3: WHAT THE COUNSELOR WRITES AFTER

Your VRC is required to document everything:

| Form | What It Records |
|------|-----------------|
| **28-1902b** | Their EH / SEH / feasibility determinations with supporting analysis |
| **28-1902n** | Detailed narrative — WHY they reached their conclusions |
| **28-8606** | Next steps from counseling |
| **CWINRS notes** | Appointment date, duration, topics, actions, follow-up |

**The OIG found (2025) that counselors aren't documenting properly.** If you get denied, request copies of your 28-1902b and 28-1902n. If they're thin or missing — that's your appeal ammunition.

### Mindset
- This is an **adjudicative interview**, not therapy — everything is being documented
- Be honest but strategic — describe your WORST days, not your best
- You're not asking for charity — you EARNED this benefit through service
- If something feels wrong, you have the right to ask for it in writing
