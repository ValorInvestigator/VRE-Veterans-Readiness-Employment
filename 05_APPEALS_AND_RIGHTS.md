# 1. YOUR RIGHTS AT A GLANCE

**Read this section if you read nothing else.**

You have the following rights in the VR&E program. These are not suggestions. They are codified in federal law and regulation.

1. **RIGHT TO APPEAL** -- Every VR&E decision is appealable. You have 1 year from the decision letter date. Three options: Supplemental Claim, Higher-Level Review, or Board of Veterans' Appeals. (Appeals Modernization Act, effective Feb 19, 2019)

2. **RIGHT TO REPRESENTATION** -- Free VSO representation at every stage. You do NOT need to be a member. Accredited attorneys and claims agents are also available. (38 CFR 14.626-14.637)

3. **RIGHT TO SEE YOUR FILE** -- You can review your complete VR&E case file, including counselor notes, evaluations, and feasibility determinations. Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a) and 38 U.S.C. 5701.

4. **RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN PLAN DEVELOPMENT** -- Your rehabilitation plan (IWRP) must be jointly developed. The VRC cannot unilaterally dictate your vocational goal. (38 CFR 21.80-21.98)

5. **RIGHT TO CHOOSE YOUR PROGRAM** -- You select a career goal consistent with your abilities, aptitudes, and interests. VR&E has funded law school, medical school, doctoral programs, and business degrees. If the VRC says these are "not allowed," that is false. (38 CFR 21.94)

6. **RIGHT TO CHANGE YOUR PLAN** -- You can request a plan amendment at any time. (38 CFR 21.94)

7. **RIGHT TO INDEPENDENT EVALUATION** -- You can submit outside medical and vocational evidence. If you disagree with the VRC's assessment, get your own expert. (38 CFR 21.53)

8. **RIGHT TO 30-DAY REVIEW** -- Before any adverse action takes effect, you get at least 30 days to review, meet informally with VA staff, and submit evidence. (38 CFR 21.420)

9. **RIGHT TO REQUEST A DIFFERENT COUNSELOR** -- If your VRC is not providing adequate service, you can request reassignment through the VR&E Officer (VREO).

10. **FEASIBILITY PRESUMPTION IN YOUR FAVOR** -- "Any reasonable doubt shall be resolved in favor of a finding of feasibility." Infeasibility requires "compelling evidence beyond any reasonable doubt." This is one of the strongest pro-veteran standards in all of VA law. (38 CFR 21.53)

11. **BINDING FAVORABLE FINDINGS** -- Any finding favorable to you is binding on all subsequent VA adjudicators, unless rebutted by clear and unmistakable error. (38 CFR 21.420(e))

---

# 2. DUE PROCESS RIGHTS -- COMPLETE

## 2A. Right to Appeal Any VR&E Decision

Every VR&E decision is appealable under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), which became law on August 23, 2017 and took effect February 19, 2019.

You have THREE options to challenge any adverse decision:
- **Supplemental Claim** (VA Form 20-0995) -- submit new evidence
- **Higher-Level Review** (VA Form 20-0996) -- senior reviewer checks for errors
- **Board of Veterans' Appeals** (VA Form 10182) -- Veterans Law Judge reviews

**Deadline:** You have ONE YEAR from the date of the decision letter to file any of these. For contested claims, the deadline is 60 days.

Appealable decisions include:
- Denial of initial eligibility
- Finding of no employment handicap or no serious employment handicap
- Determination that a vocational goal is not feasible
- Denial of your chosen training program
- Placement in a track you did not agree to
- Discontinuance of services
- Interruption of services
- Reduction or termination of benefits
- Any adverse action as defined in 38 CFR 21.420(c)

## 2B. Right to Representation

You have the right to be represented at every stage of the VR&E process by:
- An accredited Veterans Service Organization (VSO) representative -- **FREE**, no membership required
- An accredited claims agent
- An accredited attorney

Your representative can:
- Communicate with VA on your behalf
- Help gather and submit evidence
- File claims and appeals
- Attend appointments and meetings with you
- Request decision reviews
- Access your VA file with your authorization

**How to find a representative:** https://www.va.gov/get-help-from-accredited-representative/find-rep/

**Important:** Do NOT try to navigate the VR&E system alone if you are having problems. A VSO representative costs you nothing and can make a significant difference in outcomes.

## 2C. Right to Review Your File (Privacy Act)

Under the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a) and 38 U.S.C. 5701:

- You have the right to access and review your complete VA file, including your entire VR&E case file.
- You can request copies of ALL evaluations, counselor notes, feasibility determinations, and any other documents.
- You have the right to request amendment of records you believe are inaccurate.
- To request your records: Submit a Privacy Act request to the FOIA/Privacy Act Officer at your VA Regional Office.
- You can also call **1-800-827-1000** for assistance with records access.
- VA's Privacy Act request information: https://department.va.gov/privacy/privacy-act-requests/

**Why this matters:** If you are denied, your file contains the counselor's notes and reasoning. Reviewing this can reveal errors, omissions, or misapplied regulations that form the basis of an appeal.

## 2D. Right to an Independent Evaluation

If you disagree with the VRC's assessment of your employment handicap or feasibility determination:

- You can submit independent medical evidence (doctor's letters, specialist evaluations).
- You can submit independent vocational evidence (private vocational rehabilitation expert evaluations).
- A letter from your psychologist or doctor confirming that a program of vocational services is feasible is powerful evidence.
- Under 38 CFR 21.53, "any reasonable doubt shall be resolved in favor of a finding of feasibility."
- The burden is on VA to prove infeasibility -- NOT on you to prove feasibility.
- You can submit this evidence as part of a Supplemental Claim if you are appealing a denial.

## 2E. Right to Choose Your Training Program

Under 38 CFR 21.80-21.98:

- The Individualized Written Rehabilitation Plan (IWRP) is supposed to be **JOINTLY developed** by VA staff and the veteran.
- The terms and conditions of the plan must be approved and agreed to by the VRC **AND** the veteran -- it is a **SIGNED AGREEMENT**.
- You have the right to select a career goal consistent with your aptitudes, interests, and abilities.
- The VRC **cannot unilaterally dictate** your vocational goal -- it is a collaborative process.
- If the VRC refuses your chosen program, that refusal is an **appealable decision**.

**What VR&E has funded in the past:**
- Law school (JD)
- Medical school (MD/DO)
- Doctoral programs (PhD, PsyD)
- Master's programs (MBA, MS, MA)
- Business and entrepreneurship programs
- Technical certifications
- Trade school programs
- On-the-job training
- Self-employment business plans
- Computer equipment, supplies, and tools

If a VRC tells you "we don't pay for that" without citing a specific regulation, push back. Ask for the regulation in writing.

## 2F. Right to Change Your Rehabilitation Plan

Under 38 CFR 21.94:

- You, the VRC, or the vocational rehabilitation specialist may request a change in the plan **at any time**.
- A change in the long-range goal requires reevaluation by the VRC, but it IS permitted when:
  - Achievement of the current goal is no longer reasonably feasible
  - Your circumstances have changed
  - New information makes a different goal more likely to succeed
- If you do not agree with a VRC's decision on plan changes, you can:
  1. Request review from the VR&E Officer (VREO)
  2. Then request review from the Director
  3. Then file a formal appeal under AMA

## 2G. Right to Participate in Plan Development

Under 38 CFR 21.80-21.98 and 38 CFR 21.362(b):

- The plan **MUST** be jointly developed -- this is not optional for the VRC.
- VA staff must make reasonable efforts to inform you about:
  1. ALL services available under Chapter 31, especially counseling services
  2. Non-VA program assistance that VR&E staff can help you access
  3. Your specific responsibilities in developing the plan
- Your specific duties in developing the plan must be explained to you.
- VA staff are required to provide assistance to help you maintain satisfactory participation.

# 3. THE FIVE VR&E TRACKS

VR&E offers 5 support-and-services tracks. Understanding them helps you advocate for the right placement.

## Track 1: Reemployment

**Who it is for:** Veterans who want to return to work with their previous employer.

**Services include:**
- Workplace accessibility modifications
- Employer negotiations
- Case management and counseling

**Completion standard:** Considered rehabilitated after completing the employment program and maintaining suitable employment for 60 days.

## Track 2: Rapid Access to Employment

**Who it is for:** Separating veterans who already have the skills to compete for suitable jobs.

**Services include:**
- Job readiness preparation
- Resume development
- Job search assistance
- Interview coaching

**Note:** This track does NOT include long-term education or training. If you need education/training, push for Track 4.

## Track 3: Self-Employment

**Who it is for:** Veterans with job skills to start their own business, especially those who need flexible schedules or accommodating work environments due to disability.

**Services include:**
- Business plan development
- Feasibility analysis
- Training in business management
- Some business start-up costs (VA may assist)

**Common VRC bias alert:** Some counselors will tell you self-employment plans are not approved or are "too risky." This is not a valid basis for denial. Self-employment is explicitly one of the five tracks.

## Track 4: Employment Through Long-Term Services

**Who it is for:** Veterans who need additional education or training to obtain suitable employment. **This is the most popular track.**

**Services include:**
- Full tuition, books, fees, and equipment paid by VA
- Monthly subsistence allowance
- Tutorial assistance
- Counseling and case management
- Medical referrals
- Work-readiness support

**Duration:** Services generally last up to 48 months, though extensions are possible.

**This is the track that funds degrees.** If you need a bachelor's degree, master's degree, certification, or trade training, this is your track.

## Track 5: Independent Living

**Who it is for:** Veterans who may not be able to work immediately and need additional rehabilitation to live more independently.

**Services include:**
- Assistive technology
- Independent living skills training
- Connections to community-based support services
- Modifications to living environment

**Duration:** Generally up to 24 months, with possible extensions.

**Important:** This track also aims to increase your potential to return to work in the longer term. It is not a dead end.

## Eligibility Summary

| Rating | Requirement |
|---|---|
| 20% or higher | Must have an employment handicap |
| 10% | Must have a SERIOUS employment handicap |
| Active duty service member | Expects to receive an honorable discharge and have a service-connected disability rating of at least 20% |

**Discharge requirement:** Other-than-dishonorable discharge.

# 4. APPEALS PROCESS -- THREE LANES UNDER AMA

Since February 19, 2019, all VR&E appeals fall under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) framework. You choose ONE of three lanes.

## Lane 1: Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995)

**When to use:** You have NEW AND RELEVANT evidence that VA did not have when they made the original decision.

**What you can submit:**
- Medical records
- Vocational evaluations
- Expert opinions
- Buddy statements
- Employment records
- Letters from doctors, therapists, or vocational experts

**Timeline:** Must be filed within 1 year of the decision to preserve effective date. After 1 year, you can still file but may lose the earlier effective date.

**Processing time:** Average approximately 125 days, but varies.

**Best for:** When your denial was based on insufficient evidence and you can now provide more. If denied for "no employment handicap," submit a detailed letter from your doctor explaining exactly how your disabilities impair employment.

**VR&E-specific tip:** If your VRC denied your program choice, submit labor market data showing demand for your chosen career field, an independent vocational evaluation supporting your goal, and a doctor's letter confirming you can complete the training.

**How to file:**
- Online at va.gov
- By mail to your VA Regional Office
- In person at your Regional Office
- Through your VSO representative

## Lane 2: Higher-Level Review (VA Form 20-0996)

**When to use:** You believe the original decision contained an ERROR based on the evidence already in the file. No new evidence is allowed.

**Key advantages:**
- A more senior reviewer examines your case
- Can identify "duty-to-assist" errors (where VA failed to help you get evidence)
- If a duty-to-assist error is found, VA will gather the missing evidence and re-decide

**Informal Conference:**
- You can request ONE informal conference (phone call) with the reviewer
- This is NOT a formal hearing
- The reviewer will make 2 attempts to contact you or your representative
- Use the conference to point out specific errors in the original decision

**Timeline:** Must be filed within 1 year of the decision letter.

**Processing time:** Average approximately 125 days (4-5 months). Requesting an informal conference may add time.

**Important:** You CANNOT submit new evidence. The reviewer only looks at what is already in the file.

**Best for:** When the VRC clearly misapplied regulations or ignored evidence already in your file. Examples:
- VRC failed to apply 38 CFR 21.53 feasibility standard
- VRC did not consider all your service-connected disabilities
- VRC made a factual error
- VRC did not follow required procedures

**How to file:**
- Online at va.gov (currently only for disability compensation claims)
- By mail
- In person at your Regional Office
- Through your VSO representative

## Lane 3: Board of Veterans' Appeals (VA Form 10182)

**When to use:** When you want a Veterans Law Judge to review your case.

**Timeline:** Must be filed within 1 year of the decision. Contested claims: 60 days.

**Three sub-options (dockets):**

### A. Direct Review Docket
- Veterans Law Judge reviews existing evidence only
- No new evidence, no hearing
- **Target processing time:** Approximately 365 days (1 year)

### B. Evidence Submission Docket
- You can submit new evidence with your request or within 90 days
- No hearing
- **Target processing time:** Approximately 550 days (1.5 years)

### C. Hearing Docket
- You get a hearing with a Veterans Law Judge
- Can submit new evidence at the hearing or within 90 days after
- Hearing options: virtual, videoconference at local VA, or in-person in Washington, D.C.
- **Target processing time:** Approximately 730 days (2 years)

**After BVA:** If you disagree with the BVA decision, you can appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) within **120 DAYS** of the BVA decision. This is a hard deadline -- do not miss it.

**How to file:**
- Online at va.gov
- By mail (VA Form 10182)
- In person at your Regional Office
- By fax
- Through your accredited representative

## Which Lane Should You Choose?

| Situation | Best Lane |
|---|---|
| You have new evidence (doctor's letter, vocational eval) | Supplemental Claim |
| VRC made a clear error on existing evidence | Higher-Level Review |
| You want to argue the law was misapplied | Board Appeal (Direct Review) |
| You have new evidence AND want a judge | Board Appeal (Evidence Submission) |
| You want to testify in person | Board Appeal (Hearing) |
| You need the fastest resolution | Higher-Level Review or Supplemental Claim |
| VRC failed to follow procedures | Higher-Level Review |

---

# 5. HOW TO APPEAL SPECIFIC VR&E ISSUES

## Denial of Eligibility

1. Get the denial letter in writing -- it MUST specify the reason.
2. **If "no employment handicap":** File Supplemental Claim with medical evidence showing how disabilities impair employment. Get a doctor's letter that specifically addresses each element of 38 CFR 21.51 (vocational impairment, effects not overcome, disability contributes in substantial part).
3. **If "not feasible":** File Supplemental Claim with independent vocational evaluation or doctor's letter confirming feasibility. Cite 38 CFR 21.53: "compelling evidence beyond any reasonable doubt" is required for infeasibility.
4. **If procedural error** (VRC did not follow regulations): File Higher-Level Review.
5. **If no reason given or vague reason:** That is itself a violation of 38 CFR 21.420. File Higher-Level Review citing the notification deficiency.

## Wrong Track Placement

1. You can request a plan change under 38 CFR 21.94 at any time.
2. If VRC refuses: Request review from the VREO.
3. If VREO denies: Request review from the Director.
4. If Director denies: File formal appeal under AMA (any of the three lanes).
5. Document why the current track does not serve your rehabilitation needs and how a different track would.

## VRC Will Not Approve Your Chosen Program

1. Document why your chosen program is consistent with your abilities, aptitudes, and interests.
2. Get supporting evidence:
   - Labor market data showing demand for the career
   - Vocational expert opinion supporting the goal
   - Doctor's letter confirming you can complete the training
   - BLS (Bureau of Labor Statistics) occupational outlook data
3. Request plan amendment under 38 CFR 21.94.
4. If refused, this is an appealable decision -- use any AMA lane.
5. **Remember:** The VRC cannot unilaterally reject a program. The plan is a JOINT agreement. The VRC must cite a specific regulatory basis for any denial.

## VRC Discontinued Your Program

1. Request the discontinuance in writing with specific reasons.
2. Check whether VA followed ALL required steps under 38 CFR 21.364:
   - Did they discuss the situation with you first?
   - Did they arrange counseling and supportive services?
   - Did they interrupt the program first (before discontinuing)?
   - Did they make reasonable efforts during interruption?
   - Did they consider mitigating circumstances?
3. If any step was skipped, file Higher-Level Review citing the procedural violation.
4. If all steps were followed but you disagree, file Supplemental Claim with evidence of mitigating circumstances.

## VRC Is Unresponsive or Obstructive

1. Document every instance (dates, times, what happened).
2. Contact the VR&E Officer (VREO) -- see Section 10 for the escalation chain.
3. File VA Form 21-4138 (Statement in Support of Claim) documenting the issues.
4. Contact your Congressional representative's caseworker.
5. Call the White House VA Hotline: **1-855-948-2311**.

---

# 6. COMMON DENIAL REASONS AND HOW TO OVERCOME THEM

## 6A. "Not Feasible" Determination

**What it means:** VA says you cannot reasonably achieve your vocational goal.

**The law is on your side. 38 CFR 21.53 states:**
- (c): "Any reasonable doubt shall be resolved in favor of a finding of feasibility."
- (e): A finding of infeasibility requires "compelling evidence which establishes infeasibility beyond any reasonable doubt."
- This is the HIGHEST standard in VA law -- essentially the same standard used to convict someone of a crime. It is extremely difficult for VA to legitimately meet this standard.

**When feasibility IS established (38 CFR 21.53(d)):**
1. Vocational goals are identified
2. Your physical and mental condition permits training to begin within a reasonable timeframe
3. You either possess the necessary educational skills OR VA will provide services to develop them

**How to overcome a feasibility denial:**
- Submit an independent vocational evaluation showing the goal is achievable.
- Get a letter from your treating doctor confirming your capacity for training.
- Document any accommodations (ADA, school disability services) that make training feasible.
- Point out specifically that VA has NOT met the "beyond any reasonable doubt" standard.
- Request an extended evaluation period (38 CFR 21.57): Up to 12 months initially, with possible 6-month extensions (VR&E Officer must approve). During extended evaluation, VA provides services to help determine feasibility.
- If vocational rehabilitation is not feasible, VA MUST assess feasibility of independent living services (38 CFR 21.53(f)).

## 6B. "No Employment Handicap" Finding

**What it means:** VA says your service-connected disability does not significantly impair your ability to work.

**The three elements of employment handicap (38 CFR 21.51):**
1. **Vocational impairment** -- impaired ability to prepare for, obtain, or keep employment consistent with abilities, aptitudes, and interests
2. **Effects not overcome** -- you have not already overcome the impairment through current employment in a suitable job. Includes individuals who qualify for suitable positions but cannot secure or maintain them due to circumstances outside their control.
3. **Service-connected disability contributes in substantial part** -- must have "identifiable, measurable, or observable causative effect" on the overall vocational impairment. Does NOT need to be the sole or primary cause.

**How to overcome:**
- Submit a detailed personal statement explaining EXACTLY how each disability impacts work. Be specific and concrete.
- Provide examples: "My PTSD causes panic attacks in office environments, resulting in my being fired from 3 jobs in 2 years." "My back injury prevents sitting for more than 30 minutes, which eliminates all desk work." "My TBI causes cognitive difficulties that prevent me from performing the technical work I was trained for."
- Get a medical opinion letter connecting disabilities to employment barriers, addressing all three elements above.
- Show employment history demonstrating impact: job losses, missed work, inability to perform duties, reduced hours, demotion.
- Demonstrate you cannot get or keep "suitable employment" -- work that does NOT worsen your condition, IS stable, and MATCHES your abilities, aptitudes, and interests.
- If employed: Show that your current employment is NOT suitable (it aggravates your condition, is unstable, or does not match your abilities). BVA case law holds that an employed veteran CAN still have an employment handicap.

## 6C. "Not Serious Employment Handicap" (For 10% Rated Veterans)

**What it means:** Veterans rated below 20% need a "serious employment handicap" (SEH) finding for full VR&E eligibility.

**The three elements of SEH (38 CFR 21.52):**
1. **Significant vocational impairment** -- significantly impaired ability to prepare for, obtain, or keep employment consistent with abilities, aptitudes, and interests.
2. **Effects not overcome** -- you have not already overcome the impairment through current suitable employment.
3. **Service-connected disability contributes in substantial part** -- identifiable, measurable, or observable causative effect on the overall SIGNIFICANT vocational impairment. Does not need to be the sole cause.

**Factors VA must consider in evaluating "significance" (38 CFR 21.52):**
- Number and severity of disabling conditions
- Presence of neuropsychiatric conditions
- Adequacy of education and training for employment
- Unemployment and underemployment patterns
- Reliance on government support programs
- Complexity of service and assistance needs
- Labor market discrimination or barriers
- Other employment-related factors

**How to overcome:**
- Document that your disability has a measurable, significant impact on work capacity.
- Show poor employment history, unstable employment, or inability to work in your trained field.
- Get a vocational expert's opinion on your employability specifically addressing the "significance" factors listed above.
- Submit evidence of maladaptive behavior patterns, unemployment periods, or employment instability.
- If you have a neuropsychiatric condition rated 30% or higher, emphasize this -- it is specifically called out as a factor.

## 6D. Program Discontinued for Unsatisfactory Conduct

**What must happen BEFORE discontinuance (38 CFR 21.364):**

VA can ONLY discontinue after ALL of these steps:
1. Case manager discussed the situation with you
2. Case manager arranged counseling and supportive services
3. Program was first placed in "interrupted" status
4. During interruption, reasonable remedial efforts were made
5. ALL reasonable counseling efforts have been exhausted AND found not likely to be effective
6. No mitigating circumstances exist

**Mitigating circumstances that PREVENT discontinuance:**
- Effects of service-connected conditions (PTSD, TBI, chronic pain, depression, anxiety, etc.)
- Effects of non-service-connected conditions
- Family problems
- Financial problems
- Other circumstances beyond your control

**How to get reinstated:**
- VA may reinstate services if the VRC determines:
  1. The unsatisfactory conduct will NOT likely recur, AND
  2. Your proposed program (same or revised) is suitable
- Submit evidence of what has changed: new treatment, resolved personal issues, new medications working, stable housing, etc.
- Get supporting letters from therapists, doctors, or others documenting stability and readiness.
- Mental health conditions are valid mitigating circumstances per CAVC case law.

**If you believe VA skipped any of the required steps:** File Higher-Level Review immediately. Procedural violations are strong grounds for reversal.

## 6E. Prior VR&E Enrollment Issues

- You CAN re-apply if circumstances have changed.
- A new service-connected disability or worsening of existing disability can restart eligibility.
- If you were discontinued, reinstatement is possible (see 6D above).
- If you completed a prior program, you may be eligible for a SECOND program if you have a new employment handicap.
- A higher disability rating since your last participation changes the calculus.

## 6F. Delimiting Date Expired (12-Year Rule)

**The basic rule:** The 12-year period of eligibility ends 12 years from the LATER of:
- Date you received notice of separation from active duty, OR
- Date you received your first VA service-connected disability rating.

**CRITICAL EXCEPTIONS -- when the 12-year limit does NOT apply:**

1. **Discharged on or after January 1, 2013:** NO TIME LIMIT. The 12-year rule was eliminated for these veterans entirely.

2. **Serious Employment Handicap (SEH):** Eligibility can be extended INDEFINITELY if you have an SEH. Criteria for SEH extension:
   - 50% or higher disability rating, OR
   - Neuropsychiatric disability rated 30% or higher, OR
   - 30-40% disability with poor work history or special circumstances, OR
   - History of unemployment, unstable employment, or maladaptive behavior patterns

3. **Medical impediment:** The 12-year clock PAUSES during any period when participation is infeasible for 30 or more consecutive days due to a medical condition (service-connected or non-service-connected).

4. **Delayed disability rating:** The clock starts from the date of RATING NOTIFICATION, not discharge. If you did not get rated for years after discharge, the clock starts from when VA notified you of the rating.

5. **Character of discharge upgrade:** The clock restarts from the date of the discharge upgrade.

# 7. SATISFACTORY CONDUCT AND COOPERATION -- FULL REGULATORY TEXT

## 38 CFR 21.362 -- Satisfactory Conduct and Cooperation

### (a) General
The successful development and implementation of a program of rehabilitation services require the full and effective participation of the veteran in the rehabilitation process.

### (b) VA Responsibility
VA shall make a reasonable effort to inform the veteran and assure his or her understanding of:
1. The services and assistance which may be provided under Chapter 31 to help the veteran maintain satisfactory cooperation and conduct and to cope with problems directly related to the rehabilitation process, especially counseling services.
2. Other services which Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) staff can assist the veteran in securing through non-VA programs.
3. The specific responsibilities of the veteran in the process of developing and implementing a program of rehabilitation services, especially the specific responsibility for satisfactory conduct and cooperation.

### (c) Veteran's Responsibility
A veteran requesting or being provided services under Chapter 31 must:
1. Cooperate with VA staff in carrying out the initial evaluation and developing a rehabilitation plan.
2. Arrange a schedule which allows him or her to devote the time needed to attain the goals of the rehabilitation plan.
3. Seek the assistance of VA staff, as necessary, to resolve problems which affect attainment of the goals of the rehabilitation plan.
4. Conform to procedures established by VA governing pursuit of a rehabilitation plan including: enrollment, course changes, leave, medical care, and supplies.
5. Conform to the rules and regulations of the training or rehabilitation facility at which services are being provided.

### (d) Responsibility for Determining Satisfactory Conduct and Cooperation
VR&E staff with case management responsibility will:
1. Monitor the veteran's conduct and cooperation as necessary to assure consistency with provisions of paragraph (c).
2. Provide authorized assistance to enable the veteran to maintain satisfactory conduct and cooperation.

**Authority:** 38 U.S.C. 3111

## 38 CFR 21.364 -- Unsatisfactory Conduct and Cooperation

### (a) General
VA may discontinue services when a veteran has failed to maintain satisfactory conduct or cooperation, BUT ONLY after:
- ALL reasonable counseling efforts have been made AND found not likely to be effective
- AND no mitigating circumstances exist

Services can be reinstated if a Counseling Psychologist or Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor determines:
1. The problematic conduct is unlikely to recur
2. The proposed rehabilitation program suits the veteran's abilities, aptitudes, and interests

### (b) Required Procedures When Conduct Is Unsatisfactory
When conduct or cooperation does not meet the standards of 38 CFR 21.362(c), the case manager MUST:
1. **DISCUSS** the situation with the veteran
2. **ARRANGE SERVICES**, particularly counseling, to address underlying problems
3. **INTERRUPT** the program if issues persist, allowing intensified intervention efforts

If remedial efforts during interruption fail, the case moves to "discontinued" status -- BUT ONLY IF no mitigating circumstances apply.

### Mitigating Circumstances (that prevent discontinuance)
Three recognized categories:
1. Service-connected or non-service-connected condition effects
2. Family or financial hardships
3. Other circumstances beyond the veteran's control

When mitigating circumstances exist, cases may remain in "interrupted" status pending reassessment for program reentry.

## Attendance Requirements
- You must follow the attendance policies of your training institution.
- Excessive absences can trigger an unsatisfactory conduct review.
- However, absences due to disability-related issues are mitigating circumstances under 38 CFR 21.364.
- Document all disability-related absences with medical evidence.

## Grade Requirements
- You must make satisfactory academic progress per your training institution's standards.
- Failing grades can trigger review, but disability-related academic struggles are mitigating circumstances.
- Request accommodations through your school's disability office AND through VR&E.
- If you are struggling, PROACTIVELY seek help from your VRC and school -- do not wait for VA to act.

# 10. ESCALATION CHAIN -- HOW TO GO OVER YOUR VRC'S HEAD

If your VRC is unresponsive, obstructive, or you believe they are not following regulations, here is the chain of escalation:

## Step 1: Document Everything
Before escalating, create a written record:
- Dates and times of all communications (or attempted communications)
- What was said or decided
- Emails sent and received
- Appointments missed by the VRC
- Decisions you disagree with and why

## Step 2: Contact the VRC's Supervisor
- Ask your VRC who their supervisor is, or
- Call your Regional Office VR&E division and ask for the supervisory VRC.
- Explain your concerns concisely and factually.
- Request that the supervisor review your case.

## Step 3: Contact the VR&E Officer (VREO)
The VR&E Officer manages the entire VR&E division at your Regional Office. They are the VRC's boss.

**How to find your VREO:**
- VA VR&E Officer Directory: https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov (search for VR&E Officers)
- Find your Regional Office website, go to "About Us" then "Leadership Team"
- VA email format is typically: firstname.lastname@va.gov
- Call your Regional Office and ask to speak with the VR&E Officer

**What to say:** Present your documented concerns factually. Request a case review and, if appropriate, reassignment to a different counselor.

## Step 4: Contact the Regional Office Director
If the VREO does not resolve your issue:
- File a formal written complaint with the Regional Office Director.
- Send it certified mail, return receipt requested.
- Include all documentation.

## Step 5: File VA Form 21-4138
Submit a Statement in Support of Claim (VA Form 21-4138) documenting all issues. This creates an official record in your VA file.

## Step 6: Congressional Inquiry
Contact your U.S. Representative or Senator's office:
- Every office has a caseworker for VA issues
- A Congressional inquiry creates an official record and often accelerates VA action
- Find your Representative: https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative
- House Committee on Veterans' Affairs: 202-225-3527

## Step 7: White House VA Hotline
**Phone: 1-855-948-2311**
- Available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year
- Staffed 90% by veterans or employees with veteran family members
- They document concerns and expedite referrals
- This is NOT a clinical or emergency line -- it is for complaints about VA services

## Step 8: VA Inspector General
For fraud, waste, abuse, or gross mismanagement:
- Hotline: **1-800-488-8244**
- Online complaint: https://www.vaoig.gov/hotline/online-forms/submit-a-complaint
- Address: 810 Vermont Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20420

## VR&E e-VA Customer Service
VA also has an e-VA customer service portal for VR&E issues:
- Phone: **1-800-827-1000** (ask for VR&E assistance)

---

# 11. VA NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS -- WHAT THEY MUST TELL YOU

Under 38 CFR 21.420:

## What VA Must Include in Every Decision Notification:

1. **Identification of issues adjudicated**
2. **Summary of evidence** considered
3. **Applicable laws and regulations**
4. **Favorable findings** (which are then BINDING on all subsequent adjudicators)
5. **In denials:** Identification of elements not satisfied leading to the denial
6. **Explanation of how to access evidence** used in making the decision
7. **Summary of applicable review options** available to you

## Adverse Actions -- Your 30-Day Protection

An "adverse action" is any action that:
- Denies Chapter 31 benefits when requested
- Reduces or diminishes benefits being received
- Terminates benefits for reasons other than scheduled interruptions

**Before any adverse action takes effect, VA MUST:**
- Give you at least **30 days** to review the proposed action
- Allow you to **meet informally** with VA representatives
- Allow you to **review the basis** for the decision, including all documents
- Allow you to **submit relevant material** during the 30-day period

**If VA did NOT give you 30 days notice:** That is a procedural violation and grounds for a Higher-Level Review.

## Binding Favorable Findings

**38 CFR 21.420(e):** "Any finding favorable to the veteran is binding on all subsequent agency of original jurisdiction and Board of Veterans' Appeals adjudicators, unless rebutted by evidence that identifies a clear and unmistakable error in the favorable finding."

**What this means:** If VA previously found that you HAVE an employment handicap, or that your goal IS feasible, they cannot reverse that finding without proving "clear and unmistakable error" -- an extremely high bar. If a new VRC tries to reverse a prior favorable finding, cite this regulation.

# 13. RECENT CASE LAW AND BVA/CAVC DECISIONS

## CAVC Remand: Marine Corps Veteran VR&E Termination

**Facts:** Female Marine Corps veteran (served Aug 1989 - Mar 1992) appealing Board's termination of her VR&E benefits.

**What the CAVC found wrong with the BVA decision:**
1. Board failed to consider regulations requiring VA to provide assistance to help veterans maintain satisfactory participation.
2. Board did not adequately address whether VA properly placed the veteran into "interrupted" and "discontinued" status.
3. Board failed to consider whether her mental health condition warranted keeping her in interrupted status for increased support.
4. Board failed to make necessary factual findings regarding multiple potentially applicable regulations.
5. VA withdrew a promised semester option without proper justification after the veteran successfully completed a summer course as required.

**Result:** Case remanded (sent back) for BVA to reconsider with proper regulatory compliance.

**Implications for all veterans:**
- VA MUST follow regulatory procedures for status changes -- they cannot skip steps.
- Mental health conditions are valid mitigating factors that can prevent discontinuance.
- VA must honor preliminary agreements about vocational pathways.
- VA must document that adequate assistance was provided before any adverse action.

*Source: CCK Law analysis of CAVC decision (https://cck-law.com/blog/court-remands-board-decision-to-deny-vocational-rehabilitation-and-employment-benefits/)*

## Key Legal Standards Established by Case Law

### Feasibility Standard (38 CFR 21.53)
- "Compelling evidence which establishes infeasibility beyond any reasonable doubt" is required to deny feasibility.
- "Any reasonable doubt shall be resolved in favor of a finding of feasibility."
- This is one of the strongest pro-veteran standards in all of VA law. Courts have consistently upheld that VA must meet this high bar.

### Duty to Assist in VR&E
- VA has an affirmative duty to assist you in developing your claim AND your rehabilitation plan.
- This includes helping you gather evidence, providing counseling, and connecting you with services.
- If VA fails in this duty, a Higher-Level Reviewer can identify a "duty-to-assist error" and send the case back.
- **AMA Note:** VA's duty to assist was modified under AMA. Once VA makes its initial decision, some duty-to-assist obligations are reduced. This makes it critical to build the strongest possible case BEFORE the initial decision.

### Employment Handicap Totality Standard
- BVA decisions consistently hold that the employment handicap determination must consider the TOTALITY of the veteran's situation.
- A veteran who IS employed can still have an employment handicap if the employment is not "suitable" (i.e., it aggravates the disability, is unstable, or does not match abilities/aptitudes/interests).
- A veteran who qualifies for a suitable job but cannot obtain or keep it for reasons beyond their control still has an employment handicap (38 CFR 21.51(b)).

### Binding Favorable Findings
- Once VA makes a favorable finding (e.g., "veteran has an employment handicap"), that finding is BINDING on all subsequent adjudicators.
- It can only be overturned by a showing of "clear and unmistakable error" -- an extremely high legal bar.
- If a new VRC tries to reverse a prior favorable determination, cite 38 CFR 21.420(e).

## How to Research Additional BVA Decisions

# 14. COMMON VRC BIASES AND MYTHS -- WHAT THEY TELL YOU THAT IS NOT TRUE

## MYTH: "VR&E does not pay for graduate school / law school / medical school"

**FALSE.** VR&E has funded law school (JD), medical school (MD/DO), doctoral programs (PhD, PsyD, EdD), and master's programs (MBA, MS, MA) for decades. There is no regulation prohibiting graduate or professional education. If your VRC says this, ask them to cite the specific regulation. They cannot, because it does not exist.

## MYTH: "Self-employment is not approved" or "Self-employment plans are too risky"

**FALSE.** Self-employment is explicitly one of the five VR&E tracks (Track 3). A VRC cannot categorically deny self-employment plans. Each must be evaluated on its merits. If your VRC refuses to even consider self-employment, that is a violation of the regulatory framework.

## MYTH: "We can only fund 4-year programs" or "We don't fund programs longer than X months"

**PARTIALLY FALSE.** While there are general guidelines on program length, they are not absolute caps. Extensions are available. The key question is whether the program is the most effective way to achieve your vocational goal. If a 6-year program (e.g., a bachelor's plus a master's) is the path to suitable employment, it can be approved.

## MYTH: "You have to take the first job offer"

**FALSE.** You are entitled to "suitable employment" -- work that does NOT worsen your condition, IS stable, and MATCHES your abilities, aptitudes, and interests. You are not required to accept unsuitable employment.

## MYTH: "Your computer request is denied -- we don't buy computers"

**MISLEADING.** Computer/laptop purchases are at the VRC's discretion (case-by-case), but they are routinely approved for students in educational programs. If your training program requires a computer (and most do), VA can and should provide one. If denied, ask for the denial in writing and appeal.

## MYTH: "You need to pick from this list of approved programs"

**FALSE.** There is no master list of "approved programs." You select a career goal consistent with your abilities, aptitudes, and interests. The VRC evaluates feasibility -- they do not pick from a menu.

## MYTH: "You already used your VR&E benefits, you cannot come back"

**PARTIALLY FALSE.** If circumstances have changed (new disability, worsened condition, new employment handicap), you can re-apply. If you were discontinued, reinstatement is possible under 38 CFR 21.364.

# 16. APPOINTMENT PREPARATION CHECKLIST

## BEFORE the Appointment

- [ ] Know your disability rating percentage and ALL rated conditions.
- [ ] Prepare a WRITTEN STATEMENT explaining EXACTLY how each service-connected disability impacts your ability to work. Be specific and concrete. Do not say "I have PTSD." Say "My PTSD causes severe anxiety in crowded environments, flashbacks triggered by loud noises, insomnia averaging 3 hours of sleep per night, and difficulty concentrating for more than 20 minutes, all of which have resulted in my being fired from 3 jobs in the past 2 years."
- [ ] Have a CLEAR VOCATIONAL GOAL in mind. Research the career:
  - [ ] Educational requirements (what degree/certification is needed)
  - [ ] Labor market demand (BLS Occupational Outlook: https://www.bls.gov/ooh/)
  - [ ] Salary expectations
  - [ ] Physical requirements (compatible with your disabilities)
  - [ ] Programs available in your area or online
- [ ] Gather supporting documents:
  - [ ] Current resume
  - [ ] Academic transcripts (if any)
  - [ ] Medical records showing disability impacts on work
  - [ ] Employment history showing instability, terminations, or inability to work
  - [ ] Any letters from doctors connecting disabilities to employment barriers
  - [ ] Labor market research for your chosen career field
- [ ] Complete VA Form 28-1902W before the appointment if provided. Fill out Section IX carefully -- this tells the VRC what you are interested in so they can prepare.
- [ ] Print this document or have it on your phone for reference.
- [ ] Consider bringing a support person or VSO representative.

## DURING the Appointment

- [ ] Be specific about how disabilities impact work. Give concrete examples with real consequences (job losses, performance problems, physical limitations).
- [ ] State your career goal clearly and explain WHY it is consistent with your abilities, aptitudes, and interests.
- [ ] Ask these questions:
  - "What track are you recommending for me and why?"
  - "What services are available to me under Chapter 31?"
  - "What are the terms of the rehabilitation plan?"
  - "When will I receive a written copy of the plan?"
  - "What are my appeal rights if I disagree with any determination?"
  - "Who is your supervisor?" (Write down the name)
- [ ] Do NOT sign anything you do not fully understand or agree with.
- [ ] The IWRP is a signed agreement -- READ IT CAREFULLY before signing. If you need time to review it, say so. You are not required to sign on the spot.
- [ ] If the VRC pushes you into a track you do not want, say: "I would like to explore [your preferred option] and I understand I have the right to participate in plan development under 38 CFR 21.80."
- [ ] If the VRC says something is "not allowed," ask: "Can you cite the specific regulation that prohibits this?"
- [ ] TAKE NOTES during the meeting. Document what the VRC says, what was decided, and any commitments made.
- [ ] If denied anything, ask: "Will I receive this decision in writing with the specific reasons for denial and my appeal rights?"

## AFTER the Appointment

- [ ] Get a copy of everything you signed.
- [ ] Write down your notes from the meeting while they are fresh.
- [ ] If you received a decision you disagree with, NOTE THE DATE -- you have 1 YEAR to appeal.
- [ ] If denied, request the specific reason in writing (required by 38 CFR 21.420).
- [ ] Consider contacting a VSO or accredited attorney before filing an appeal.
- [ ] File a Privacy Act request if you want to review your complete VR&E file.
- [ ] If you were not treated properly, begin the escalation process (Section 10).
