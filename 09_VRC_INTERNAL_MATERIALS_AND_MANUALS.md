## 1. M28R MANUAL (LEGACY VR&E PROCEDURES MANUAL)

### Overview

The M28R is the legacy Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Service Manual that governed ALL VR&E counselor decisions prior to its replacement by the M28C. It remains available online and many of its procedures carried forward into the M28C. The M28R states which benefits and services are covered and the VA employees that administer them. Its authority is based on the United States Code (U.S.C.), the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), and other relevant VA policy documents.

**Key fact: The M28R is the guide ALL Vocational Rehabilitation Counselors MUST use when making decisions. They are NOT allowed to make a decision that runs contrary to it.**

### M28R Structure (8 Parts)

The M28R is organized into Parts denoted by uppercase Roman numerals:

- **Part I** -- Introduction and Overview of VR&E Program
- **Part II** -- Office Administration
- **Part III** -- Program Administration (Initial Evaluation, Comprehensive Evaluation, Referral Procedures)
- **Part IV** -- Evaluation, Entitlement, and Rehabilitation Planning (IWRP Development)
- **Part V** -- Case Management (Monitoring, Annual Reviews, Case Outcomes)
- **Part VI** -- Employment Services
- **Part VII** -- Other Benefits Case Management
- **Part VIII** -- Program Oversight

Each Part contains Sections (A, B, C) and Chapters (numbered).

## 2. M28C MANUAL (CURRENT REPLACEMENT MANUAL)

### Overview

The M28C is the CURRENT Veteran Readiness and Employment Manual that replaced the M28R. It was created as a guide for VA Vocational Rehabilitation Counselors to determine eligibility, entitlement, placement, and case planning for ALL VA claimants. Approximately 50 different parts of the previous manual were updated prior to publication of the M28C.

**Counselors are MANDATED to follow the M28C.** The M28C policy manual is supposed to interpret ambiguities in regulations to help VA employees make proper decisions.

## 6. GAO REPORTS ON VR&E / CHAPTER 31

### GAO-20-28: Counselor Consistency (2019)

- **Title:** VA Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment: Additional Assessment Could Enhance Consistency among Counselors
- **Date:** December 10, 2019
- **URL:** https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-20-28
- **Full Report PDF:** https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-20-28.pdf

**Key Findings:**
- VA trains and monitors counselors to develop complete VR&E plans BUT does NOT assess the consistency of plans across counselors for veterans with similar circumstances
- Plans may differ among similarly situated veterans because of counselors' experience and judgment
- VA checks the quality of plans but does NOT look at consistency from counselor to counselor
- **Recommendation:** VA should assess consistency of VR&E plans among counselors by, for example, comparing counselors' responses to identical hypothetical cases, and take mitigating steps if warranted
- VA concurred and planned to develop a consistency study

**WHY THIS MATTERS FOR VETERANS:** This GAO report officially documents that different counselors may give different veterans with identical circumstances completely different plans. If your counselor denies something, another counselor might approve it.

**Key Findings:**
- About half of the ~17,000 veterans who entered VR&E in FY2003 and received employment services were placed in suitable jobs
- One-third left the program
- It often took veterans 6+ years to achieve success, partly due to temporary program exits
- Veterans faced challenges related to mental health conditions, working with multiple VR&E counselors over time, and civilian employers' limited understanding of military experience
- VA had weaknesses in performance metrics, workload management, and consistency across ~400 VR&E locations

### GAO-09-34: Better Incentives, Workforce Planning, Performance Reporting (2009)

## 15. KEY ENTITLEMENT CRITERIA AND DEFINITIONS

### Employment Handicap (EH)

An employment handicap exists if the veteran's service-connected disability impairs their ability to obtain and maintain a job. Finding of EH results in entitlement for veterans within the 12-year basic period with 20%+ rating.

### Serious Employment Handicap (SEH)

A serious employment handicap exists when an individual has a SIGNIFICANT impairment of the ability to prepare for, obtain, or keep employment in an occupation consistent with their abilities, aptitudes, and interests. Required for:
- Veterans rated at 10%
- Veterans beyond the 12-year basic period of eligibility

### Basic Period of Eligibility

- **Pre-January 1, 2013 discharges:** 12 years from separation date OR date of first VA disability rating notification, whichever is later
- **Post-January 1, 2013 discharges:** NO time limit on eligibility
- **Extensions available** for: medical condition (21.42), serious employment handicap (21.44), independent living (21.45), recall to active duty (21.46)

### Feasibility

The VRC must determine whether it is reasonably feasible for the veteran to achieve a vocational goal given disabilities, aptitudes, interests, and available VR&E services. Feasibility is governed by 38 CFR 21.53.

## 18. COUNSELOR CASELOAD AND STAFFING DATA

### Current State (2025)

- **Current ratio:** 1 counselor per 175 clients (as of July 2025)
- **Goal ratio:** 1 counselor per 125 clients
- **Advocacy target:** Some organizations advocate for 1:85
- **Pending cases:** Over 186,000 pending (backlog)
- **Some counselors carry 240+ cases** with new cases almost weekly
- **VA News on Case Management:** https://news.va.gov/143576/vre-new-case-management/

### Historical Ratios

- 2018: Rolling average of 133 veterans per counselor (down from 140 in 2016)
- 2017: 1 counselor per 136.4 cases
- 2011: Average caseload 130-150 per counselor

### Hiring Initiatives

- August 2018: VA began hiring 172 vocational rehabilitation counselors to reduce ratio to 1:125
- VA press release: https://news.va.gov/press-room/va-expands-vocational-rehabilitation-and-employment-program-to-improve-service-to-veterans-hiring-effort-underway-to-reduce-counselor-to-caseload-ratio/

### WHY THIS MATTERS FOR VETERANS

Your counselor is likely overworked. With 175+ cases each, counselors have limited time per veteran. This means:
- You need to come prepared and organized
- Do not rely on your counselor to research options for you
- Document everything in writing
- Follow up on every commitment made verbally
- Know the manual better than they do

### Counselor Resignation Story

A VR&E counselor publicly resigned over hiring freeze and caseload overwhelm:

## 19. TACTICAL PREPARATION FOR VR&E APPOINTMENTS

### Before Your Initial Evaluation

1. **Know your vocational goal.** Do NOT walk in saying "I need help." Be precise: "I want to pursue [specific career] through [specific training program]." Connect your goal to your abilities, aptitudes, and interests.

2. **Document how your disabilities create employment barriers.** The VA must see that your service-connected disabilities are genuinely preventing you from working in a suitable occupation. Be specific about functional limitations.

3. **Complete VA Form 28-1902W thoroughly.** Section IX is where you state your interests so the VRC can prepare labor market searches. Make it work for you.

4. **Research the M28C/M28R sections relevant to your situation.** Print key pages. If a counselor tells you something is "not allowed," ask them to cite the specific M28C section.

5. **Know the entitlement criteria by heart:**
   - 20%+ rating = employment handicap required
   - 10% rating = serious employment handicap required
   - Post-2013 discharge = no 12-year limit

### During the Appointment

1. **The initial evaluation typically lasts 2-3 hours** including testing to determine abilities and interests.

2. **Everything must be in writing.** Verbal commitments mean nothing. Insist on written plan documentation.

3. **Joint participation is MANDATORY.** The plan must be jointly developed (38 CFR 21.80). If the counselor is dictating terms without your input, cite the regulation.

4. **If denied, ask for the specific regulation or M28C section.** Counselors sometimes deny requests based on personal preference rather than actual policy.

5. **Common counselor claims that are FALSE:**
   - "We don't fund law school / medical school / doctoral programs" -- FALSE, VR&E has funded these for decades
   - "Self-employment plans aren't available" -- FALSE, Self-Employment is one of the five tracks
   - "You can only get [X months] of training" -- the standard is 48 months for Employment Through Long-Term Services, with extensions available

### After the Appointment

1. **Get a copy of your signed rehabilitation plan (VAF 28-8872).** The VRC is required to provide one.

2. **Request a copy of the VAF 28-1902b** (entitlement determination documentation).

3. **If denied, exercise your appeal rights immediately.** You have 1 year for Higher-Level Review or Board Appeal.

4. **Consider filing an ethics complaint** if the counselor: failed to conduct a comprehensive evaluation, imposed their own values on your career goals, denied your participation in plan development, or made decisions contrary to the M28C.

5. **FOIA your own VR&E file.** It is separate from your regular VA records. Request it to see exactly what the counselor documented.

## DOCUMENT NOTES

**Total unique URLs compiled:** 180+
**Categories covered:** 19 major sections
**Sources span:** Federal regulations, VA manuals, OIG audits, GAO reports, CRS analyses, professional certification standards, ethics codes, congressional testimony, academic textbooks, veteran community forums, legal analysis, and current legislation.

**Bottom line for appointment preparation:** The VR&E counselor is bound by 38 CFR Part 21, the M28C manual, and the CRCC Code of Professional Ethics. They must conduct a comprehensive evaluation, jointly develop a plan with the veteran, document entitlement determinations on specific VA forms, and provide copies of all signed documents. If any of these obligations are not met, the veteran has appeal rights and ethics complaint mechanisms available.
