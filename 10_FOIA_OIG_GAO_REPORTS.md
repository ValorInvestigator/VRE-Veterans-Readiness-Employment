## 1. VA OIG REPORTS

### 1A. The Accuracy of Veteran Readiness and Employment Claims Cannot Be Assessed Because of Insufficient Documentation (2025)

- **Report Number:** VAOIG-23-03328-197
- **Date:** September 30, 2025
- **URL:** https://www.vaoig.gov/VAOIG-23-03328-197-FINAL.pdf
- **Alt URL:** https://www.oversight.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/2025-11/VAOIG-23-03328-197-FINAL.pdf
- **Type:** Audit (Office of Audits and Evaluations)
- **Summary:** The OIG found that the accuracy of VR&E claims CANNOT be assessed because of insufficient documentation maintained by VR&E counselors. This is a significant finding because it means the VA itself cannot verify whether veterans are receiving proper entitlements under Chapter 31. The documentation deficiencies are systemic enough that the OIG could not complete its accuracy assessment.
- **Significance for internal operations:** Reveals that VR&E counselors are not maintaining adequate case files, which means there is no reliable paper trail to audit counselor decision-making, plan development, or benefit determinations. This is the most recent and arguably most damning OIG finding on the program.

### 1B. Veteran Readiness and Employment Staff Improperly Sent Participants to VET TEC Courses (2024)

- **Report Number:** VAOIG-23-00967-64
- **Date:** March 28, 2024
- **URL:** https://www.vaoig.gov/sites/default/files/reports/2024-03/vaoig-23-00967-64.pdf
- **Alt URL:** https://www.oversight.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/2024-04/vaoig-23-00967-64.pdf
- **Type:** Review (Office of Audits and Evaluations)
- **Scope:** All nine VET TEC-only training providers receiving tuition payments processed by VR&E from April 1, 2019, through December 31, 2022
- **Key Findings:**
  - VR&E staff improperly enrolled participants in the Veteran Employment Through Technology Education Courses (VET TEC) pilot program
  - Staff did not receive any training specific to the VET TEC program
  - School certifying officials were allowed to email enrollment forms to counselors instead of using the required VA-ONCE system
  - VR&E counselors did not verify that facility codes on authorization forms matched codes used by school certifying officials on enrollments
  - Controls were ineffective -- counselors missed opportunities to determine if courses were approved before participants started
  - **$387,000 in improper payments** identified for improperly authorized VET TEC courses
- **Recommendations:**
  1. Develop and implement policies and system controls to ensure all programs approved for use by counselors meet requirements of applicable laws and regulations
  2. Train all appropriate VR&E regional office staff on manual requirements to verify programs are approved for use before selecting participants and to confirm facility codes match from authorization through enrollment
- **Significance:** Shows breakdown in basic verification procedures and lack of counselor training on programs they were using. The $387K in improper payments is likely an undercount since it only covers the audit period.

### 1C. Audit of Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Program Subsistence Allowance Payments (2018)

- **Report Number:** VAOIG-16-05121-110
- **Date:** Published 2018
- **URL:** https://www.va.gov/oig/pubs/VAOIG-16-05121-110.pdf
- **Alt URL:** https://www.vaoig.gov/reports/audit/audit-vocational-rehabilitation-and-employment-program-subsistence-allowance-payments
- **Type:** Audit
- **Key Findings:**
  - VR&E subsistence allowance payments were "generally accurate and timely"
  - In a sample of 120 payments reviewed from November 2016, OIG identified only 4 errors at 2 of 4 regional offices visited (3.3% error rate)
  - Cumulative monetary impact: $12,532 across the 4 error cases
  - Three of four errors caused by failure to update dependent information
  - No significant timeliness issues with initial payments
  - In March 2017, VR&E conducted refresher training on updating dependent information
- **Recommendations:** None (scope curtailed due to small monetary impact)
- **Significance:** One of the few OIG audits that found VR&E operating relatively well. However, the small sample size (120 payments) and narrow scope (subsistence allowance only) limits the conclusions that can be drawn.

### 1D. Los Angeles Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Program Generally Met Requirements After Hiring Additional Staff (2019)

- **Report Number:** Available at VAOIG website
- **Date:** 2019
- **URL:** https://www.vaoig.gov/reports/review/los-angeles-vocational-rehabilitation-and-employment-program-generally-met
- **Type:** Review (Congressional request)
- **Key Findings:**
  - Program generally complied with VA requirements for staffing, veteran contacts, rehabilitation outcomes, and supply reimbursements
  - Despite staffing shortages from FY 2013 to FY 2017, program showed progress
  - Veterans rehabilitated increased from 238 in FY 2015 to 446 in FY 2018
  - Employees generally made required number of veteran contacts
  - Reimbursement requests for academic supplies processed accurately
  - Approval percentage comparable to national program for past four years
- **Recommendations:** None
- **Significance:** Shows that VR&E CAN function when adequately staffed. The improvement from 238 to 446 rehabilitations after hiring was a direct result of reducing counselor caseloads. This is relevant to the broader counselor workload debate.

---

### 1E. Audit of Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Program Operations (2007)

- **Report Number:** VAOIG-06-00493-42
- **Date:** December 17, 2007
- **URL:** https://www.vaoig.gov/sites/default/files/reports/2007-12/VAOIG-06-00493-42.pdf
- **Type:** Audit
- **Summary:** Comprehensive audit of VR&E program operations covering services and assistance including evaluation, counseling, prosthetic appliances, communication devices, adaptive automobile equipment, wheelchair training, and Independent Living Program administration. Also addressed recommendations from the 2004 VR&E Task Force Report.
- **Significance:** One of the most comprehensive OIG examinations of the full VR&E program operations. Followed up on the sweeping 2004 Task Force recommendations.

---

### 1F. VA OIG Testimony to Congress on VR&E (July 2025)

- **Date:** July 16, 2025
- **URL:** https://docs.house.gov/meetings/VR/VR10/20250716/118499/HHRG-119-VR10-20250716-SD002.pdf
- **Type:** OIG testimony/submission to House Veterans Affairs Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity
- **Summary:** OIG provided a document to the subcommittee summarizing its oversight findings on the VR&E program, likely incorporating findings from both the 2024 VET TEC report and the 2025 documentation accuracy report.
- **Significance:** Direct communication from OIG to Congress about VR&E program deficiencies.

## 2. GAO REPORTS

### 2A. VA Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment: Additional Assessment Could Enhance Consistency among Counselors (2019)

- **Report Number:** GAO-20-28
- **Date:** December 10, 2019
- **URL:** https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-20-28
- **PDF:** https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-20-28.pdf
- **Type:** Report to congressional requesters
- **Key Findings:**
  - VR&E plans may differ among similarly situated veterans because of individual counselors' experience and judgment
  - VA checks quality of plans but does NOT assess consistency from counselor to counselor
  - VA trains and monitors counselors to develop complete VR&E plans but does not assess whether similarly situated veterans get consistent outcomes
  - No systematic comparison of how different counselors treat similar cases
- **Recommendation:** VA should assess consistency of VR&E plans among counselors by, for example, comparing counselors' responses to identical hypothetical cases, and take mitigating steps if warranted
- **VA Response:** Concurred and planned to develop a consistency study
- **Significance:** This is the most important GAO report for understanding counselor discretion problems. It documents that two veterans with identical disabilities and backgrounds could get completely different rehabilitation plans depending on which counselor they are assigned. There is no mechanism to prevent or even detect this inconsistency.

### 2B. VA Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment: Further Performance and Workload Management Improvements Are Needed (2014)

- **Report Number:** GAO-14-61
- **Date:** January 14, 2014
- **URL:** https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-14-61
- **PDF:** https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-14-61.pdf
- **Type:** Report to congressional requesters
- **Key Findings:**
  - About HALF of ~17,000 veterans who entered VR&E in FY 2003 and received employment services were placed in suitable jobs
  - One-third LEFT the program without successful completion
  - Most others were STILL participating (after 10+ years)
  - Veterans often took 6 YEARS OR MORE to achieve success, partly due to temporary program departures
  - Veterans face challenges related to mental health conditions, working with multiple VR&E counselors over time, and civilian employers' limited understanding of military experience
  - VA took steps to improve performance and workload management but weaknesses remain
- **Recommendations:** Six recommendations including improvements to staff allocation among regional offices and collecting information on workload management approaches
- **Significance:** The 50% placement rate after 10+ years is a devastating statistic. The finding that veterans commonly work with multiple counselors (disrupting continuity) and that mental health conditions create barriers that VR&E is not adequately addressing are both critical for understanding program failures.

### 2C. VA Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Program: Improved Oversight of Independent Living Services and Supports Is Needed (2013)

- **Report Number:** GAO-13-474
- **Date:** June 2013
- **URL:** https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-13-474
- **PDF:** https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-13-474.pdf
- **Type:** Report to congressional requesters
- **Key Findings:**
  - Of 9,215 veterans entering the IL (Independent Living) track from FY 2008-2011, most were male Vietnam-era veterans in their 50s-60s, ~60% Army, most prevalent disabilities were PTSD and tinnitus
  - Most common IL benefits: counseling services and computers. Less common: gym memberships, camping equipment, and a BOAT
  - VR&E spent nearly $14 million on IL benefits in FY 2008 -- average ~$6,000 per IL veteran
  - VR&E exercised LIMITED OVERSIGHT to ensure appropriate and consistent IL administration across regions
  - IL plans completed in 384 DAYS on average nationally, with regional variation from 150 to 895 DAYS
  - VR&E counselors had difficulty obtaining timely responses from VHA (Veterans Health Administration) -- physicians responded to IL referrals late or not at all
  - VR&E's written policies for approving IL expenditures "may not have been appropriate" -- regions could purchase costly or questionable items without Central Office approval
  - VR&E did not monitor regional variation in IL caseloads and benefits
- **Recommendations:** Explore options to enhance VHA coordination, strengthen IL oversight, reassess benefits approval policy
- **VA Response:** Generally agreed
- **Significance:** The 150-to-895-day variation in plan completion times across regions is extraordinary. The fact that counselors could approve purchases like boats without Central Office approval shows a near-total lack of financial controls. The VHA non-responsiveness finding shows inter-agency coordination failures.

### 2D. VA Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment: Better Incentives, Workforce Planning, and Performance Reporting Could Improve Program (2009)

- **Report Number:** GAO-09-34
- **Date:** January 26, 2009
- **URL:** https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-09-34
- **PDF:** https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-09-34.pdf
- **Type:** Report to congressional requesters
- **Key Findings:**
  - VR&E launched the Five-Track Employment Process to strengthen employment focus, but veterans' financial incentives were NOT updated to match
  - Without aligned incentives, veterans needing immediate employment assistance may not seek VR&E services
  - VR&E officials acknowledged that financial incentives for veterans receiving employment services could be beneficial
  - Workforce planning was insufficient -- no strategic process for collecting and using relevant data
  - Performance reporting did not adequately capture program outcomes
- **Recommendations:** Align financial incentives with employment mission; engage in strategic workforce planning; improve performance reporting
- **Significance:** Identifies a fundamental structural problem: the program was redesigned around employment outcomes but the financial incentives still pointed veterans toward education/training tracks. This misalignment likely contributes to the long completion times documented in GAO-14-61.

### 2E. VA Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment: Service Contract Management Is Improving, but Challenges Remain (2007)

- **Report Number:** GAO-07-568R
- **Date:** April 23, 2007
- **URL:** https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-07-568r
- **Full Text:** https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GAOREPORTS-GAO-07-568R/html/GAOREPORTS-GAO-07-568R.htm
- **Type:** Correspondence (report to congressional committees)
- **Key Findings:**
  - In FY 2006, VR&E obligated ~$702 million and served ~89,000 veterans
  - VA achieved some progress implementing OIG contract-related recommendations
  - Key challenges remained: regional offices not fully applying VA contracting guidance, training inadequate for contracting officers, delays communicating with VA headquarters, inadequate reporting capabilities
- **Significance:** Shows that even basic contract management for VR&E service providers was deficient. When regional offices cannot properly manage contracts with training providers, veterans are at risk of being sent to substandard programs.

---

### 2F. Vocational Rehabilitation: More VA and DOD Collaboration Needed to Expedite Services for Seriously Injured Servicemembers (2005)

- **Report Number:** GAO-05-167
- **Date:** January 2005
- **URL:** https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-05-167
- **PDF:** https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-05-167.pdf
- **Full Text:** https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GAOREPORTS-GAO-05-167/html/GAOREPORTS-GAO-05-167.htm
- **Type:** Report to congressional committees
- **Key Findings:**
  - 10,000+ servicemembers injured in Afghanistan and Iraq
  - VA instructed regional offices to prioritize seriously injured for VR&E services and deployed additional staff to five major Army treatment facilities
  - VA relied on regional offices to identify seriously injured veterans because DOD data sharing agreement was pending
  - Regional offices had information of VARYING COMPLETENESS AND RELIABILITY
  - VA had NO POLICY for maintaining contact with seriously injured veterans who did not initially apply for VR&E but might later need services
  - Some regional offices attempted contact; others did not
  - DOD had concerns that VA outreach could work against military retention goals
  - VA lacked access to DOD data needed to identify eligible veterans
- **Recommendations:** VA and DOD should collaborate on data sharing to promote recovery and return to work
- **Significance:** During the height of the Iraq/Afghanistan wars, VA could not reliably identify or reach seriously injured veterans who needed VR&E. The inter-agency data sharing failure meant veterans fell through the cracks.

### 2G. VA Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Program: GAO Comments on Key Task Force Findings and Recommendations (2004)

- **Report Number:** GAO-04-853
- **Date:** June 15, 2004
- **URL:** https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GAOREPORTS-GAO-04-853/html/GAOREPORTS-GAO-04-853.htm
- **Type:** GAO analysis of VA Task Force report
- **Key Findings:**
  - The VA's own 2004 VR&E Task Force found "little evidence" that the program's efforts to obtain jobs for rehabilitated veterans had been effective
  - Task Force made 110 RECOMMENDATIONS
  - Emphasized VR&E should focus on employment rather than training/education and emphasize clients' skills rather than disabilities
  - Many recommendations aligned with GAO governmentwide work on strategic planning and IT investment
  - VR&E needed more systematic analysis of information systems before further investment
- **Significance:** The VA's OWN task force concluded the program was ineffective at its core mission of getting veterans employed. 110 recommendations suggests the scale of dysfunction. This is a useful baseline for measuring whether any subsequent reforms actually worked.

### 2H. Vocational Rehabilitation: VA Continues to Place Few Disabled Veterans in Jobs (1996)

- **Report Number:** HEHS-96-155
- **Date:** September 3, 1996
- **URL:** https://www.gao.gov/products/hehs-96-155
- **Full Text:** https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GAOREPORTS-HEHS-96-155/html/GAOREPORTS-HEHS-96-155.htm
- **Type:** Report to congressional committees
- **Key Findings:**
  - Only ~8% of approximately 74,000 veterans found eligible for vocational rehabilitation were rehabilitated over the prior 5 years
  - ~50% of eligible veterans continued receiving program services indefinitely
  - Program had chronic difficulty actually placing veterans in employment
- **Significance:** Establishes that VR&E's placement failures are not new -- they go back at least three decades. The 8% rehabilitation rate is abysmal by any standard.

---

### 2I. Vocational Rehabilitation: Better VA Management Needed to Help Disabled Veterans Find Jobs (1992)

- **Report Number:** HRD-92-100
- **Date:** September 4, 1992
- **URL:** https://www.gao.gov/products/hrd-92-100
- **Type:** Report
- **Key Findings:**
  - Assessed effectiveness of VA vocational rehabilitation in helping disabled veterans obtain and maintain employment
  - Examined reasons for high drop-out rate
  - Evaluated VA standards for measuring program success
  - Found that better VA management was needed
- **Significance:** The earliest major GAO assessment. Identifies the high dropout rate as a persistent problem -- the same issue documented 22 years later in GAO-14-61 (2014).

---

### 2J. Vocational Rehabilitation: VA Needs to Emphasize Serving Veterans With Serious Employment Handicaps (1992)

- **Report Number:** HRD-92-133
- **Date:** 1992
- **URL:** https://www.gao.gov/products/hrd-92-133
- **Type:** Report
- **Key Findings:**
  - VA was not adequately prioritizing veterans with serious employment handicaps
  - Program resources were being spread across veterans with varying levels of need
  - More emphasis needed on serving the most severely disabled
- **Significance:** Documents that even the most disabled veterans -- the program's primary intended beneficiaries -- were not being adequately served.

---

### 2K. Department of Veterans Affairs: Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Program -- Changes to Subsistence Allowance (2012)

- **Report Number:** GAO-12-391R
- **Date:** January 2012
- **URL:** https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-12-391r
- **Type:** Congressional review of VA rulemaking
- **Key Findings:**
  - Reviewed VA's rule changes to subsistence allowance following Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Improvements Act of 2010
  - Veterans eligible for both Chapter 31 (VR&E) and Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) can elect military housing allowance instead of regular subsistence allowance
  - Rule discontinued subsistence payments during periods between school terms
  - VA complied with applicable requirements in promulgating the rule
- **Significance:** Documents the financial policy framework affecting VR&E participants. The ability to elect housing allowance instead of subsistence created new complexity for counselors and veterans.

---

### 2L. GAO High Risk List -- VA Disability Benefits Management

- **URL:** https://files.gao.gov/reports/GAO-26-108789/index.html (2026 update)
- **Status:** VA disability compensation management has been on GAO's High-Risk List since 2003
- **VR&E Connection:** VA provides health care, housing, vocational rehabilitation, and employment-related services through multiple administrations. VR&E is part of the ecosystem that GAO has flagged as high-risk.
- **Open Recommendations:** As of October 2025, 4 of 10 GAO recommendations on VA disability benefits remained open
- **Significance:** While VR&E is not separately listed as "high risk," it operates within the broader VA benefits management framework that GAO has flagged for over two decades of persistent management challenges.

    - Report on average wait times to meet with a counselor after applying
    - Report on program participation data
  - **External Review:** VA required to contract with outside entity for one-time comprehensive review of VR&E program with improvement recommendations
  - **CBO Estimate:** Less than $500,000 over 2025-2030
- **Significance:** This is a direct legislative response to the cascade of GAO and OIG findings. The 96-month enrollment cap addresses the GAO-14-61 finding that veterans were spending 6+ years in the program. The reporting requirements address the documentation and performance tracking failures. The external review provision suggests Congress has lost confidence in VA's ability to self-assess.

- **Note:** Search returned general VA program pages but no specific VR&E FOIA releases in the reading room. May require direct browsing of the reading room portal.

### 6B. VA FOIA Main Page

- **URL:** https://department.va.gov/foia/
- **FOIA Library:** https://department.va.gov/foia/foia-library/
- **Description:** Central VA FOIA portal. VR&E program records, counselor workload data, and internal policy documents are requestable through this process.

### 6C. VA OIG FOIA Portal

- **URL:** https://www.vaoig.gov/foia

### 6D. MuckRock

- **Search Results:** No specific VR&E or vocational rehabilitation FOIA requests found in MuckRock's public database as of February 2026
- **URL:** https://www.muckrock.com (search for "VR&E" or "vocational rehabilitation")
- **Note:** This represents an untapped FOIA opportunity. MuckRock's collaborative platform could be used to submit VR&E-targeted FOIA requests for internal counselor workload data, program policy memoranda, disciplinary actions, and complaint records.

### 6E. GovernmentAttic.org

- **Search Results:** No specific VR&E documents found in governmentattic.org's collection as of February 2026
- **URL:** https://governmentattic.org
- **Note:** Another untapped resource. Governmentattic specializes in obtaining and publishing government documents. VR&E internal documents do not appear to have been requested.

### 6F. VBA Annual Benefits Reports (Public Data)

- **URL:** https://www.benefits.va.gov/REPORTS/abr/
- **VR&E Chapter (FY 2023):** https://www.benefits.va.gov/REPORTS/abr/docs/2023-veteran-readiness-employment.pdf
- **Description:** VA publishes annual benefits reports with a dedicated VR&E chapter containing program statistics, outcomes, and performance data. This is publicly available data, not FOIA-required.

---

## 7. VA ANNUAL PERFORMANCE DATA

### 7A. VR&E Longitudinal Study

- **URL:** https://www.benefits.va.gov/VOCREHAB/VRELongitudinalStudy.asp
- **FY 2023 Study:** https://www.benefits.va.gov/VOCREHAB/docs/FY2023-longitudinal-study.pdf
- **Description:** VA tracks VR&E participant outcomes longitudinally. Available for multiple years (2022, 2023, 2024+).
- **Significance:** The longitudinal data is the closest thing to an objective measure of whether VR&E actually improves veterans' employment and earnings outcomes over time.

### 7B. FY 2024 Annual Performance Report

- **URL:** https://www.va.gov/opa/docs/remediation-required/oei/VA-FY24-Annual-Performance-Report.pdf
- **VR&E Findings:** VBA exceeded the target for positive outcomes by 14% in FY 2024. Veterans completing VR&E in FY 2024 increased annual post-rehabilitation salary by 2% over FY 2023 completers.
- **Significance:** VA's self-reported performance data. Should be compared against GAO and OIG independent findings for a complete picture.

### 7C. Counselor Staffing Data

- **Source:** VA press release
- **URL:** https://news.va.gov/press-room/va-expands-vocational-rehabilitation-and-employment-program-to-improve-service-to-veterans-hiring-effort-underway-to-reduce-counselor-to-caseload-ratio/
- **Key Data:**
  - VA targeting 1:125 counselor-to-caseload ratio
  - 941 counselors working across 56 regional offices
  - Hiring 172 additional VR counselors (target: 1,113 total)
- **Significance:** The 1:125 target ratio is VA's own acknowledgment that previous caseloads were too high. Compare to the GAO findings about counselor inconsistency and the OIG finding about documentation failures -- both likely exacerbated by excessive caseloads.

### 7D. VR&E Case Management System Modernization

- **URL:** https://news.va.gov/143576/vre-new-case-management/
- **Key Data:** New system reduced average application processing time from 7 days to just over 2 days
- **Significance:** Shows VA is attempting modernization, but processing speed is different from quality of service delivery.

## 8. KEY THEMES ACROSS ALL REPORTS

### Theme 1: Chronic Placement Failures (1992-Present)
The VR&E program has struggled to place veterans in suitable employment for over 30 years. GAO documented an 8% rehabilitation rate in 1996, a 50% rate in 2014 (after 10+ years of participation), and the VA's own 2004 Task Force found "little evidence" the program's job placement efforts were effective. This is not a new problem -- it is a structural one.

### Theme 2: Counselor Discretion Without Oversight
GAO-20-28 (2019) established that VR&E plans vary significantly based on which counselor a veteran is assigned, and VA has no mechanism to assess or ensure consistency. Combined with VAOIG-23-03328 (2025) finding that claim documentation is so poor accuracy "cannot be assessed," the picture is of a program where individual counselors operate with wide discretion and minimal accountability.

### Theme 3: Caseload-Driven Failures
Multiple reports link counselor caseload levels to program quality. The LA regional office improved from 238 to 446 rehabilitations after hiring additional staff. VA acknowledged the problem by targeting a 1:125 ratio. But the OIG documentation failure report suggests that even with improved ratios, systemic quality issues persist.

### Theme 4: Inter-Agency Coordination Breakdowns
GAO-05-167 documented VA-DOD data sharing failures for injured servicemembers. GAO-13-474 documented VA internal coordination failures between VR&E and VHA. These inter-agency gaps mean veterans fall through cracks between bureaucracies.

### Theme 5: Financial Control Weaknesses
GAO-13-474 found that VR&E counselors could approve purchases (including boats and camping equipment) without Central Office approval. GAO-07-568R found regional offices not applying contracting guidance. VAOIG-23-00967 found $387,000 in improper VET TEC payments. Financial controls are consistently weak.

### Theme 6: Program Duration Creep
Veterans spending 6+ years in VR&E (GAO-14-61) and 50% of eligible veterans "still participating" after a decade prompted Congress to propose a 96-month (8-year) cap in H.R. 3579. The program's open-ended nature may be enabling indefinite participation without employment outcomes.

### Theme 7: Congressional Response Cycle
Congress holds VR&E hearings approximately every 2-3 years, receives GAO/OIG reports documenting the same issues, proposes reforms, and then the cycle repeats. The persistence of the same findings across decades suggests that hearing-driven oversight alone is insufficient to drive lasting program reform.

## APPENDIX: UNTAPPED FOIA OPPORTUNITIES

The following categories of VR&E internal documents do NOT appear to have been obtained through FOIA by any public requester (based on MuckRock and governmentattic.org searches):

1. **Internal counselor performance metrics** -- How does VA measure individual counselor effectiveness?
2. **Disciplinary actions against VR&E counselors** -- How many counselors have been disciplined for poor performance?
3. **VR&E complaint records** -- How many veterans file complaints about their VR&E counselors, and what happens to those complaints?
4. **Regional office performance comparisons** -- Internal data on which regional offices perform best/worst
5. **Counselor training materials and curricula** -- What exactly are counselors taught?
6. **VR&E program policy memoranda** -- Internal guidance documents that shape counselor decision-making
7. **Denied entitlement data** -- How many veterans are found entitled but denied specific services?
8. **Appeal and dispute resolution data** -- How many veterans appeal VR&E decisions and what are the outcomes?
9. **Contractor performance evaluations** -- How does VA rate the training providers and service contractors it uses?
10. **Internal response to OIG/GAO findings** -- Implementation tracking for GAO and OIG recommendations

These represent potential FOIA targets for investigating internal VR&E operations.
