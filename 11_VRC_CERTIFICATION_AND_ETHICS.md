## 1. CRC (CERTIFIED REHABILITATION COUNSELOR) CERTIFICATION

### What It Is

The CRC (Certified Rehabilitation Counselor) credential is issued by the Commission on Rehabilitation Counselor Certification (CRCC). It is the premier national certification for rehabilitation counselors. The CRCC is accredited by the National Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA).

**Key point for veterans:** VA VHA Rehabilitation Counselor positions REQUIRE current, full, and unrestricted CRC certification. VA VR&E Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor positions require a qualifying master's degree but do not always mandate CRC certification -- though many VRCs hold it.

### Basic Eligibility to Sit for the CRC Exam

- Master's degree (or higher) in rehabilitation counseling or a closely related field from a CACREP-accredited or equivalent program
- Supervised clinical experience (internship) in rehabilitation counseling
- The exam is 175 multiple-choice questions (150 scored, 25 unscored field-test items)
- Two sections: "Counseling" (72 items) and "Rehabilitation and Disabilities" (78 items)
- Pass/fail based on criterion-referenced scoring

## 2. CRC EXAM KNOWLEDGE DOMAINS

The CRC exam covers 12 knowledge domains based on the CRCC 2021 Job Task Analysis (JTA). These domains define what every certified rehabilitation counselor is TESTED ON and therefore is EXPECTED TO KNOW:

| # | Domain | % of Exam |
|---|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Professional Orientation and Ethical Practice | 10.7% |
| 2 | Counseling Theories, Techniques, and Evidence-Based Practices | 11.3% |
| 3 | Group and Family Counseling | 4.7% |
| 4 | Crisis and Trauma Counseling and Interventions | 6.0% |
| 5 | Medical and Psychosocial Aspects of Chronic Illness and Disability | 9.3% |
| 6 | Assessment/Evaluation, Occupational Analysis, and Service Implementation | 10.7% |
| 7 | Career Development and Job Placement | 9.3% |
| 8 | Business Engagement | 7.6% |
| 9 | Community Resources and Partnerships | 8.0% |
| 10 | Case Management | 10.0% |
| 11 | Health Care and Disability Management | 5.0% |
| 12 | Research, Methodology, and Performance Management | 5.3% |

**Total: 150 scored items across 12 domains**

### Why This Matters to Veterans

Every CRC-certified counselor was tested on ALL of these domains. If your VRC is not performing career development, job placement, case management, community resource identification, or assessment -- they are failing to apply knowledge they were specifically certified in.

Domain 1 (Professional Orientation and Ethical Practice) at 10.7% means ethics is the FIRST and one of the LARGEST tested areas. Your counselor was tested on their ethical obligations to you.

## 3. CRC CONTINUING EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS

### Recertification Cycle

- **100 hours** of continuing education required every **5 years**
- **Minimum 10 hours** must be in **ethics**
- Certification renewal application opens approximately 4 months before expiration
- Pre-approved CE providers are listed on the CRCC website
- Failure to complete CE hours results in loss of certification

### What This Means

Your counselor (if CRC-certified) must complete 100 hours of professional development every 5 years, including 10 hours specifically on ethics. They cannot claim ignorance of ethical standards -- they are required to study them continuously.

## 4. CRCC CODE OF PROFESSIONAL ETHICS

### Overview

The Code of Professional Ethics for Certified Rehabilitation Counselors (effective January 1, 2023) is the MANDATORY ethics code governing all CRC and CCRC holders. It was adopted September 2022 and replaced the 2017 version.

The code is organized into the following major sections:

### Section A: The Counseling Relationship

**A.1. Welfare of Those Served**
- The primary obligation of rehabilitation counselors is to respect the dignity and promote the welfare of clients
- Counselors must act in the client's best interest

**A.2. Respecting Diversity**
- Counselors must not discriminate based on disability, age, culture, gender, etc.

**A.3. Client Rights**
- Clients have the freedom to choose whether to enter into or remain in a professional relationship
- Clients have the right to participate in ongoing rehabilitation planning
- Clients have the right to make decisions to refuse any services or modality changes

**A.4. Avoiding Value Imposition**
- Counselors must not impose their own values on clients

**A.5. Roles and Relationships with Clients**
- Counselors must avoid dual relationships (friendships, business partnerships) with clients
- Conflicts of interest must be avoided

### INFORMED CONSENT (Critical Standard)

Rehabilitation counselors must:
- Clearly explain the nature of the counseling relationship
- Explain goals, risks, benefits, and the limits of confidentiality BEFORE services begin
- Informed consent is ONGOING and must be reassessed throughout the relationship
- Clients need relevant and adequate information to make informed decisions
- Cultural implications of informed consent must be considered
- For clients who may lack capacity, counselors must still seek assent and include them in decision-making

### CLIENT AUTONOMY AND EMPOWERMENT

**Standard C.1.c. Empowering the Client (NEW in 2023)**
- Counselors must empower clients to make informed choices in decision-making and treatment planning
- Autonomy = respecting the rights of clients to be self-governing within their social and cultural framework
- In rehabilitation counseling, this is especially critical because societal attitudes often assume that individuals with disabilities cannot or should not make their own decisions

### Six Foundational Ethical Principles

1. **Autonomy** -- Respecting client self-determination
2. **Beneficence** -- Acting in the client's best interest
3. **Non-maleficence** -- Do no harm
4. **Justice** -- Ensuring fairness and equality
5. **Fidelity** -- Maintaining trust and reliability
6. **Veracity** -- Truthfulness

### Section B: Confidentiality, Privileged Communication, and Privacy

- Trust is the cornerstone of the counseling relationship
- Counselors must communicate the legal and ethical parameters of confidentiality in a culturally competent manner
- Information shared by a client must be kept confidential
- Disclosure permitted ONLY when: client poses danger to self or others, or required by law
- Clients generally have a right to their records
- At initiation AND throughout counseling, counselors must inform clients of the limitations of confidentiality

### Section C: Advocacy and Accessibility

**C.1. Advocacy and Attitudinal Barriers**
- Counselors must address attitudinal barriers including stereotyping and discrimination toward individuals with disabilities
- Advocacy at individual, group, institutional, and societal levels to:
  - (a) Promote opportunity and access
  - (b) Improve quality of life for individuals with disabilities
  - (c) Remove potential barriers to services
  - (d) Address stigma (NEW in 2023)
  - (e) Foster systems change when appropriate (NEW in 2023)
- When advocacy requires disclosure of confidential information, counselors must obtain and document consent from the client and disclose only minimal information

### Section D: Multicultural Considerations (NEW Section in 2023)

- Seeks to reduce bias, minimize discrimination, and prevent harm in practice
- Cultural competencies are enforceable tenets of conduct

### Section E: Evaluation and Assessment

- Appropriate tool selection required
- Informed consent required for assessments
- Results must be clearly explained to clients

### Section F: Professional Responsibility

- Counselors must practice only within the boundaries of their education, training, and experience
- Must engage in ongoing education to stay current with best practices
- Must accurately represent their credentials and qualifications

### Section I: Resolving Ethical Issues

- Consultation encouraged for uncertain situations
- Obligation to address apparent violations by other counselors

### KEY TAKEAWAY FOR VETERANS

If your VRC is CRC-certified, they are BOUND by this code. Violations can be reported to CRCC. The code requires them to:
- Empower YOU to make your own decisions
- Advocate FOR you against barriers
- Keep you informed at every step
- Respect your right to refuse services
- Not impose their values on your plan
- Act in YOUR best interest, not the system's convenience

## 5. CRCC SCOPE OF PRACTICE

### Definition of Rehabilitation Counseling

Rehabilitation counseling is a systematic process that assists persons with physical, mental, developmental, cognitive, and emotional disabilities to achieve their personal, career, and independent living goals in the most integrated setting possible through the application of the counseling process.

The counseling process involves communication, goal setting, and beneficial growth or change through self-advocacy, psychological, vocational, social, and behavioral interventions.

### Specific Professional Activities Within the Scope of Practice

1. **Assessment and Appraisal** -- Selecting, administering, scoring, and interpreting instruments designed to assess aptitudes, abilities, achievements, interests, personal characteristics, disabilities, and mental/emotional/behavioral disorders

2. **Counseling (Individual and Group)** -- Cognitive, affective, behavioral, and systemic counseling strategies including developmental, wellness, pathologic, and multicultural principles; individual, group, marriage, and family counseling and psychotherapy

3. **Case Management** -- Interviewing, counseling, planning rehabilitation programs, coordinating services, interacting with significant others, placing clients and following up, monitoring progress, and problem-solving

4. **Job Analysis, Job Development, and Placement Services** -- Including assistance with employment and job accommodations

5. **Career Development** -- Career counseling and vocational assessment

6. **Referral and Service Coordination** -- Connecting clients with appropriate resources

7. **Diagnostic Description and Treatment** -- Of persons with mental, emotional, and behavioral disorders or disabilities

8. **Advocacy** -- Supporting persons with disabilities in advocacy activities to achieve equal status and empowerment

## 7. VA HANDBOOK 5005 STANDARDS

VA Handbook 5005 establishes the qualification standards for VA employment. The vocational rehabilitation counselor standards are found in Part II, Appendix F2 (updated July 28, 2023).

### Key Standards

- The position covers GS-0101-9/11/12 grade levels
- Education must include evidence of a supervised internship
- Specialized experience must reflect management of vocational rehabilitation counseling or case management workload
- The counselor must work with persons with a wide variety of disability conditions

### What This Means for Veterans

Your VRC is required to have a master's degree and supervised clinical experience BEFORE they are hired. They are not learning on the job at your expense -- they are supposed to arrive with professional-level training. If they lack competence in core counseling skills, that is a qualification standard issue.

## 8. 38 USC 3104 -- STATUTORY SERVICES REQUIRED

### What the Law Says the VA MUST Provide

38 USC Section 3104 defines the scope of services and assistance the VA Secretary shall provide to eligible veterans under Chapter 31. These are STATUTORY obligations -- they are written into federal law.

### The 16 Categories of Required Services

1. **Evaluation and Reevaluation** -- Including periodic reevaluations as appropriate to determine employment handicap and feasible vocational goals

2. **Counseling** -- Educational, vocational, psychological, employment, AND personal adjustment counseling

3. **Allowances** -- Financial support (authorized under 38 USC 3108)

4. **Work-Study Allowance** -- As authorized by 38 USC 3485

5. **Placement Services** -- Job placement AND post-placement services to ensure satisfactory adjustment in employment

6. **Personal and Work Adjustment Training** -- Skill development programs

7. **Vocational Training** -- Tuition, fees, books, supplies, handling charges, licensing fees, and equipment determined necessary

8. **Loans** -- As authorized by 38 USC 3112

9. **Medical Treatment** -- Services from Chapter 17 (VA medical care)

10. **Assistive Devices** -- Prosthetics, eyeglasses, and corrective equipment

11. **Family Services** -- Support necessary for the veteran's rehabilitation

12. **Self-Employment Support** -- License fees and equipment for severely disabled veterans pursuing self-employment

13. **Travel Expenses** -- Including special transportation allowances for disability-related needs

14. **Special Services** -- Blindness/deafness services including language training, mobility assistance, interpreter services, and technical aids

15. **Independent Living Services** -- Assistance achieving maximum daily living independence

16. **Incidental Services** -- Other necessary goods and services the Secretary deems appropriate

### Subsection (b): Program Approval

Rehabilitation programs require Secretary approval. Training courses should be approved for purposes of Chapter 30 or 33 "to the maximum extent practicable," though waivers are available.

### Subsection (c): Prioritization

The Secretary may prioritize services based on need, including disability ratings and employment handicap severity. Changes to prioritization require 90-day advance notice to Congress.

### KEY TAKEAWAY

These are not suggestions. These are statutory entitlements established by Congress. If your VRC is not providing or arranging for these services when they are needed, they are potentially violating federal law.

## 9. 38 CFR PART 21 -- COUNSELOR DUTIES UNDER FEDERAL REGULATION

### Individualized Written Rehabilitation Plan (IWRP) -- 38 CFR 21.84

An IWRP will be developed for each veteran eligible for rehabilitation services under Chapter 31. The regulation states the plan is intended to:

1. **Provide structure** to translate evaluation findings into specific rehabilitation goals and objectives
2. **Monitor progress** in achieving rehabilitation goals
3. **Assure timeliness** of assistance by VA staff in providing services specified in the plan
4. **Evaluate effectiveness** of planning and delivery of rehabilitation services by VR&E staff

### VRC Primary Responsibility -- 38 CFR 21.84

The Counseling Psychologist (CP) or Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) has the **PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY** for the preparation of plans.

### Joint Development Requirement

The plan **MUST be jointly developed** by VA staff AND the veteran. The terms and conditions must be approved and agreed to by the CP or VRC, the vocational rehabilitation specialist, AND the veteran.

### Counselor Determinations Required -- 38 CFR 21.50

The CP or VRC must determine:
1. Whether the individual has an employment handicap
2. Whether an individual with an employment handicap has a SERIOUS employment handicap
3. Whether achievement of a vocational goal is currently reasonably feasible

### After Plan is Signed

The counselor MUST assist the veteran to implement the plan to achieve gainful suitable employment or independent living. This includes providing:
- Ongoing counseling
- Coordination of services
- Tutorial assistance
- Training in job-seeking skills
- Medical and dental referrals
- Adjustment counseling
- Payment of training allowance
- Other services as required

### Counselor Expertise Standard

The regulation recognizes that the counselor "possesses particular expertise in determining which vocational goals are feasible and which are not, and in evaluating the veteran's interests, aptitudes, and abilities over an extended period of time."

### Periodic Review Required -- 38 CFR 21.96

The VRC and the veteran will **periodically review and evaluate** the IWRP. A **comprehensive review will be conducted at least once every 12 months** and will be annotated on the IWRP.

### KEY TAKEAWAY

The regulations explicitly require: joint plan development WITH the veteran, ongoing counseling and coordination, at least annual comprehensive reviews, and the counselor bears PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY for the plan. If your VRC is making unilateral decisions, failing to consult you, or skipping annual reviews, they are violating federal regulation.

## 10. VA M28R MANUAL -- COUNSELOR PROCEDURES

The M28R is the VA's internal procedures manual for the Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) Service. Key provisions:

### VRC Case Management Duties

- The VRC is responsible for ensuring the veteran remains on track and focused to successfully complete the rehabilitation plan
- The rehabilitation plan must be based on the results of a comprehensive evaluation
- The VRC must maintain regular contact with the veteran

### Contact Requirements

- Level and frequency of contact must be appropriate to the veteran's needs
- Tele-counseling is an approved method of contact
- Training records must be reviewed regularly
- The counselor must monitor course and program length and rate of pursuit

### Plan Modification Rules

A change in the veteran's long-range goal may ONLY be made following a reevaluation by the VRC. A change may be made when:
- Achievement of the current goal is no longer reasonably feasible, OR
- Circumstances have changed or new information makes a different goal more likely to succeed

### Unsatisfactory Conduct and Cooperation

The manual addresses what happens when veterans are placed in "interrupted" or "discontinued" status. This is a common area of conflict -- the manual has specific procedures that must be followed.

### KEY TAKEAWAY

There is a FORMAL PROCEDURES MANUAL that VRCs are required to follow. If your VRC is not following documented procedures for case management, plan changes, or status decisions, you can request the specific M28R section and ask why procedures were not followed.

## 11. CACREP ACCREDITATION STANDARDS

### What CACREP Is

The Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP) is the accrediting body for graduate counseling programs. The 2024 CACREP Standards became effective July 1, 2024.

### Eight Specialized Practice Areas

CACREP accredits programs in eight specialty areas including:
- Clinical Rehabilitation Counseling (Section 5-D)
- Rehabilitation Counseling (Section 5-G)

### Rehabilitation Counseling Curriculum Requirements (Section 5-G)

Programs must cover three main areas:

**Foundations (7 standards):**
- History and philosophy of rehabilitation counseling
- Legislation affecting rehabilitation services
- Theories of rehabilitation counseling
- Principles of vocational rehabilitation
- Independent living and self-determination
- Societal inclusion of people with disabilities
- Disability assessment methods

**Contextual Dimensions (17 standards):**
- Professional scope of practice
- Medical and psychosocial aspects of disability
- Individual responses to disability
- Diagnostic systems understanding
- Cultural and diversity factors
- Policy impacts on people with disabilities
- Crisis awareness
- Sexuality considerations
- Specialized services
- Benefit systems
- Assistive technology
- Advocacy responsibilities
- Legislation and regulation
- Ethics specific to rehabilitation

**Practice (13 standards):**
- Case management skills
- Functional assessment
- Assistive technology evaluation
- Evidence-based practices
- Coping strategies
- Self-advocacy promotion
- Career development
- Labor market analysis
- Integration advocacy
- Community resource facilitation
- Collaboration with medical professionals and employers

### Professional Practice Requirements

- Practicum extends across a full academic term
- Internship: 600 hours of supervised counseling with actual clients
- At least 240 hours must be direct service with actual clients
- Practicum hours cannot count toward the 600-hour internship requirement

### Guiding Principles

The 2024 standards emphasize two principles:
1. **Quality first** -- Graduates demonstrate both knowledge AND skill
2. **Unified counselor identity** -- Strong professional identity with specialization

### KEY TAKEAWAY

Your VRC's master's program (if CACREP-accredited) required at minimum 600 hours of supervised internship with actual clients, plus comprehensive coursework in all the areas listed above. They were trained in case management, advocacy, career development, assessment, and ethics. Claiming they "don't know how" to do these things contradicts their educational requirements.

## 13. CAVC CASE LAW ON VRC DUTIES

### Key Case: CAVC Remand of VR&E Denial (CCK Law)

A veteran appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) after the Board of Veterans' Appeals denied VR&E benefits.

**Facts:**
- The veteran was told she could take a summer college course, and if successfully completed, she would be considered for a semester of coursework as evaluation
- Despite successful completion, VA took away the full semester option
- VA presented her with two other options she felt were inappropriate based on her education and experience
- VA placed her in "interrupted" and then "discontinued" status

**CAVC Holding:**
- The Court agreed that the Board ERRED by failing to consider a regulation directing VR&E staff to "provide assistance which may be authorized under Chapter 31, or for which arrangements may be made under other programs to enable the veteran to maintain satisfactory conduct and cooperation"
- The Board failed to make necessary factual findings
- The Board failed to provide analysis regarding multiple potentially applicable regulations
- The Board's errors were NOT harmless
- The Board did not adequately consider whether VA followed proper procedures for placing the veteran into "interrupted" and "discontinued" status
- The Board did not consider whether the veteran's mental health condition was a mitigating circumstance requiring VA to keep her in interrupted status to provide increased assistance

**Outcome:** The Court VACATED the Board's decision and REMANDED for further proceedings.

### Duty to Assist in VR&E Context

The Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA) establishes that the VA has a legal obligation to assist veterans in gathering evidence necessary to support their claim for benefits. The CAVC provides oversight and can review BVA decisions for compliance.

Key principles from case law:
- VR&E staff are REQUIRED to provide assistance under Chapter 31
- Mental health conditions must be considered as mitigating circumstances before adverse actions
- VA must follow specific regulatory procedures when interrupting or discontinuing services
- The counselor's failure to consider applicable regulations is reversible error
- Board decisions that fail to make required factual findings will be vacated

### Important Legal Framework

- **38 USC Chapter 31** -- Statutory basis for all VR&E services
- **38 CFR Part 21, Subpart A** -- Implementing regulations
- **Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA)** -- Duty to assist obligation
- **Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA)** -- Administrative appeal level
- **CAVC** -- Judicial review of BVA decisions

## 14. GAO AND OIG AUDIT FINDINGS

### GAO-20-28: Counselor Inconsistency (December 2019)

**Title:** "VA Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment: Additional Assessment Could Enhance Consistency among Counselors"

**Key Findings:**
- Plans may differ among similarly situated veterans because of individual counselors' experience and judgment
- VA checks the quality of plans but does NOT look at consistency from counselor to counselor
- VA trains and monitors counselors to develop complete plans but does NOT assess consistency across counselors for veterans with similar circumstances

**GAO Recommendation:**
- VA should assess the consistency of VR&E plans among counselors by, for example, comparing counselors' responses to identical hypothetical cases, and take mitigating steps if warranted

**VA Response:** Concurred with the recommendation and planned to develop a consistency study

### VA OIG Report 23-00967-64 (March 2024)

**Key Findings:**
- VR&E staff improperly authorized 31 participants to attend courses offered by VET TEC training providers
- 11 additional participants at eight other providers were also improperly authorized
- VR&E Officers and Counselors were "generally unaware" of the regulations
- Staff submitted forms by email, bypassing system controls
- The executive director does not have direct authority over counselors at regional offices

**Training Response:**
- VR&E conducted training on the monthly VR&E Officer call (July 6, 2023) and VRC call (July 10, 2023) on verification procedures

### GAO-13-474 (2013) and GAO-09-34 (2009)

These earlier reports also found:
- Improved oversight of the program was needed
- Better incentives, workforce planning, and performance reporting could improve the program
- Counselor caseload management was a recurring concern

### What This Means for Veterans

Federal auditors have repeatedly found that VR&E counselors:
- Make inconsistent decisions for similarly situated veterans
- Are sometimes unaware of the regulations they are supposed to follow
- Bypass system controls
- Need better oversight and accountability

You are not imagining it if your counselor seems to be making arbitrary decisions. GAO confirmed this is a systemic problem.

## 15. HOW TO USE THIS INFORMATION

### When Writing Complaints or Appeals

1. **Cite the specific ethical standard violated** -- Reference the CRCC Code of Ethics section and standard number (e.g., "Standard A.3 requires that clients have the right to participate in ongoing rehabilitation planning")

2. **Cite the federal regulation** -- Reference 38 CFR 21.84 (IWRP requirements), 38 CFR 21.50 (counselor determinations), or 38 CFR 21.96 (annual review requirement)

3. **Cite the statute** -- 38 USC 3104 lists 16 categories of services the VA is legally obligated to provide

4. **Reference GAO findings** -- GAO-20-28 found that counselor decisions are inconsistent and VA does not assess consistency

5. **Reference the CAVC case** -- If placed in interrupted/discontinued status, cite the CAVC holding that mental health conditions must be considered as mitigating circumstances and that VA must follow specific regulatory procedures

### Key Questions to Ask Your VRC

1. "Are you CRC-certified? When does your certification expire?"
2. "Can I see my Individualized Written Rehabilitation Plan?"
3. "When was my last comprehensive annual review per 38 CFR 21.96?"
4. "What assessment tools did you use to evaluate my aptitudes and abilities per the scope of practice?"
5. "How does this plan reflect MY goals, given that 38 CFR 21.84 requires joint development?"
6. "What advocacy have you done on my behalf per Section C of the CRCC Code of Ethics?"
7. "What community resources and partnerships have you explored for me per CRC Knowledge Domain 9?"
8. "Have you considered all 16 categories of services under 38 USC 3104?"

### Where to File Complaints

1. **CRCC Ethics Complaint** (if counselor is CRC-certified): https://crccertification.com/code-of-ethics-4/
2. **VA OIG Hotline:** 1-800-488-8244 or https://www.va.gov/oig/hotline/
3. **Congressional Representative:** File a congressional inquiry
4. **Board of Veterans' Appeals:** Appeal any adverse VR&E decision
5. **CAVC:** Appeal BVA decisions to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims
6. **GAO:** Report systemic issues (Congress requests GAO reviews)

### Filing with CRCC

If your VRC holds CRC certification, you can file an ethics complaint directly with the Commission on Rehabilitation Counselor Certification. They have jurisdiction over all CRC holders regardless of employer. A substantiated ethics violation can result in:
- Reprimand
- Probation
- Suspension of certification
- Revocation of certification

### VA Internal Training (TMS)

The VA uses its Talent Management System (TMS) for internal training. While specific TMS course content is not publicly available, the OIG reports confirm that:
- Monthly VR&E Officer calls are used for training
- Monthly VRC calls are used for training
- Training is sometimes reactive (only after problems are identified)
- New counselors may have varying levels of experience, and the recent hiring push to reduce caseloads means some counselors are less experienced
