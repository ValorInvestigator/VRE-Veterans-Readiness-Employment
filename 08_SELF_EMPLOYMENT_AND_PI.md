## 1. PROGRAM OVERVIEW AND ELIGIBILITY

### What VR&E Is

VR&E (Veterans Readiness and Employment), formerly called Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment, is a Chapter 31 benefit that helps veterans with service-connected disabilities prepare for, find, and maintain suitable employment. It is an **entitlement program** -- meaning if you qualify, the VA is obligated to provide it. It is NOT discretionary.

The self-employment track is one of five VR&E service tracks. The VA describes it as being designed for veterans who have "the strong desire, skills, and drive to run a successful business" and who have "limited access to traditional employment, need flexible work schedules, or need a more accommodating work environment."

### Eligibility Requirements (ALL must be met)

1. **Service-connected disability rating:**
   - 20% or higher with an "employment handicap," OR
   - 10% with a "serious employment handicap"

2. **Employment barrier:** Your service-connected disability must create a barrier to preparing for, obtaining, or maintaining suitable employment.

3. **Discharge status:** Must be discharged under conditions other than dishonorable.

4. **Enrollment:** Must be enrolled in VR&E (apply via VA Form 28-1900).

### The 12-Year Window

Standard VR&E eligibility expires 12 years after separation from service or 12 years after your initial disability rating, whichever is later. However, veterans with a "serious employment handicap" may qualify for an extension beyond this deadline. If you are outside the 12-year window, make the case for serious employment handicap.

### Entitlement Duration

- Up to **48 months** of training and services
- Can be extended for veterans with serious employment handicaps
- The 48 months covers all education, training, and services combined
- Self-employment monitoring period (up to 18 months post-launch) is separate

### Key Distinction: Employment Program, Not Education Benefit

VR&E is fundamentally an employment program. Everything must lead to a viable employment outcome. The VA will evaluate whether your proposed business can realistically generate income sufficient to support you. This is not a grant for pursuing a hobby -- it must be a genuine business that can succeed.

---

## 2. THE COMPLETE SELF-EMPLOYMENT PROCESS: APPLICATION TO BUSINESS LAUNCH

### Step 1: Application (2-4 weeks processing)

- Submit **VA Form 28-1900** (Disabled Veterans Application for Vocational Rehabilitation)
- Can be submitted online through VA.gov, by mail to regional VA office, or in person
- VA schedules orientation appointment at nearest Regional Office (RO)
- During this wait, begin researching your business concept and gathering documentation

### Step 2: Orientation and Initial Evaluation (1-2 months)

- Attend orientation at Regional Office
- Meet your assigned Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC)
- VRC reviews your:
  - Complete service history
  - Medical records and current treatment
  - Disability ratings and functional limitations
  - Employment history
  - Education and training background
- Comprehensive assessments administered:
  - Interest inventories
  - Aptitude testing
  - Medical reviews
  - Functional capacity evaluation
- VRC determines your **Residual Functional Capacity (RFC)** -- what you can physically and mentally do
- VRC evaluates whether you have an "employment handicap" or "serious employment handicap"

### Step 3: Entitlement Determination

- VRC issues a formal determination of entitlement
- If ENTITLED: Full VR&E services are unlocked, including self-employment track
- If NOT ENTITLED: You still get basic career counseling and referrals, but not the full program
- If denied, you have appeal rights (see Section 12)

### Step 4: Rehabilitation Plan Development (2-4 weeks)

This is the CRITICAL step for self-employment.

- You and the VRC collaborate on an **Individualized Written Rehabilitation Plan (IWRP)**
- You must declare **self-employment as your vocational goal** at this stage
- The plan specifies:
  - Your vocational goal (self-employment as a PI)
  - Objectives to reach that goal (training, licensing, equipment)
  - Services VA will provide
  - Timeline and milestones
  - Evaluation criteria
- **Both you and the VRC must agree on and sign the plan**

**CRITICAL WARNING:** Do NOT agree to a rehabilitation plan that lists school or "work experience" as the goal with self-employment as a future possibility. If you sign a plan for traditional employment first, switching to self-employment later requires amending the entire plan, which some VRCs will resist. Self-employment must be THE stated vocational goal from day one.

**Know the difference:**
- **Vocational GOAL** = Self-employment as a Private Investigator (the destination)
- **OBJECTIVES** = PI training courses, business courses, licensing exams, equipment acquisition (the steps to get there)

### Step 5: Business Plan Development (Several months)

Once your IWRP names self-employment as the goal, you enter the business plan development phase.

- Work with a **Small Business Development Center (SBDC)** to develop your formal business plan
- Coordinate with **SCORE** mentors for guidance and review
- The **VA Accelerator Program** may provide a year-long mentorship and online business courses (approximately $5,000 value covered by VA)
- You receive **subsistence allowance** during this training/planning period
- Expect multiple revision cycles before the plan is submission-ready
- SBDC appointment wait times can add weeks or months

### Step 6: Feasibility Analysis (Required by regulation)

The VRC must conduct a formal feasibility analysis before approving the self-employment plan. See Section 5 for full requirements.

### Step 7: Category Assignment and Approval

Based on the feasibility analysis and business plan, your case is assigned a self-employment Category (I, II, or possibly III). See Section 3 for detailed breakdown.

- **Category II:** VRC and VR&E Officer (VREO) at regional office can approve -- faster
- **Category I:** Requires BOTH regional VREO approval AND Central Office (CO) in Washington DC approval -- 160-180 additional days

### Step 8: Business Launch and Monitoring

- Equipment and supplies procured per approved plan
- Business launches
- VA monitors for minimum 1 year, up to 18 months
- Face-to-face meetings at least 3 times per year
- Must demonstrate profitability within approximately 7 months

### Total Timeline Estimates

| Phase | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Application processing | 2-4 weeks |
| Orientation and evaluation | 1-2 months |
| Entitlement determination | 2-4 weeks |
| IWRP development | 2-4 weeks |
| Business plan development | 2-4 months |
| Feasibility analysis | 2-4 weeks |
| Category II approval (regional) | 2-4 weeks |
| Category I approval (Central Office) | 160-180 days |

| **TOTAL (Category II)** | **~4-8 months** |
| **TOTAL (Category I)** | **~9-14 months** |

---

## 3. SELF-EMPLOYMENT CATEGORIES I, II, AND III

The VA assigns your self-employment case to a category based on the scale, complexity, and cost of the proposed business. The category determines the approval authority, the funding level, and the timeline.

### Category I -- Full Self-Employment (Large Scale)

- **Description:** Businesses requiring significant startup investment, generally **over approximately $25,000** in supplies and equipment
- **Approval required:** BOTH the VR&E Officer (VREO) at the regional level AND Central Office (CO) in Washington DC
- **Timeline for CO decision:** 160-180 days from submission (on top of everything that came before)
- **Total process:** 7-14 months from initial application
- **Funding:** Provides the "full boat of business toys" -- comprehensive equipment, supplies, training, and startup costs
- **Business plan must be submitted to Central Office** for review
- **Must demonstrate profitability within 7 months**
- **SBA review and feasibility analysis required before CO submission**

**What veterans report about Category I:**
- One veteran expected $50,000-$80,000 in funding for Category I
- Another had ~$5,000 invested by VA in courses through VA Accelerator before equipment phase
- The $25,000 figure appears consistently as the practical dividing line between Category I and II
- Category I receives the most comprehensive support package

### Category II -- Smaller Scale Self-Employment (Microbusiness)

- **Description:** Businesses with lower startup costs, generally **under approximately $25,000**
- **Approval required:** VRC and VREO at regional office only -- does NOT require Central Office approval
- **Timeline:** Significantly faster than Category I (weeks, not months, for the approval phase)
- **Funding:** More limited than Category I but still covers equipment, supplies, training, and licensing
- **Can begin IWRP/IEAP self-employment plan development upon VRC approval**
- **Veterans can start as Category II and request upgrade to Category I** if the business plan expands (requires additional medical documentation, treatment plan, and current medication list)

**Strategic note:** A PI business could potentially fit into either Category I or II depending on how the startup costs are structured. A lean PI startup (provisional license, basic surveillance equipment, laptop, software) might come in under $25,000 and qualify as Category II with faster approval. A full-scale operation (multiple camera systems, vehicle modifications, office lease, advanced software suites) would push into Category I.

### Category III -- Home-Based Microbusiness / Cottage Industry

Category III is referenced in some veteran community discussions but is less clearly defined in the publicly available M28R manual sections. It appears to cover the smallest scale of self-employment -- home-based businesses with minimal startup costs. These may be approved at the VRC level with VREO concurrence.

### The Dollar Threshold Question

The exact dollar boundary between categories is **not rigidly defined** in the published regulations. The ~$25,000 figure comes from veteran community experience and forum discussions, not from a specific regulatory citation. The actual categorization depends on:
- Total VA investment required
- Complexity of the business
- Risk level
- Whether external financing (SBA, personal) is also involved
- The VRC and VREO's judgment

**Key point for your appointment:** Do not fixate on hitting a specific dollar amount to land in one category or another. Present the honest costs of your business and let the VA categorize it. Trying to inflate costs to reach Category I or deflate them to stay in Category II will undermine credibility.

## 4. WHAT VR&E CAN AND CANNOT PAY FOR

### What VA CAN Provide for Self-Employment

Per **38 CFR 21.257(d)**, VA may provide the following for self-employment:
1. Vocational training
2. Incidental training (supplementary training needed)
3. **License or required fees** (explicitly listed in the regulation)
4. Tools
5. Supplies
6. Other services authorized under 38 CFR 21.252

Per **38 CFR 21.257(e)**, for veterans with the **most severe disabilities:**
- Everything listed in (d) above, PLUS
- Additional assistance under 38 CFR 21.214 (special program supplies)

Per the **M28R Manual and general VR&E provisions**, the VA covers:
- Tuition and fees for training programs
- Books and course materials
- Office supplies
- Computer hardware (desktops, laptops, tablets)
- Computer software (business, industry-specific)
- Tools of the trade
- Equipment necessary for the business
- Tuition for needed certifications and licenses
- Application and licensing fees
- Background check fees (may be reimbursable as a required fee)
- Surety bond costs (when required for licensure)
- Business management training
- Financial management training
- Marketing training
- Startup costs directly related to the business
- Adaptive equipment for disability-related accommodations
- Subsistence allowance during training periods

Per the **VA.gov website**, self-employment services include:
- Analysis of your business concept
- Training in small-business operations, marketing, and finances
- Tuition assistance to obtain needed certifications/licenses
- Financial assistance to cover applicable fees and related startup costs

### What VA CANNOT Pay For

Per **38 CFR 21.214**, the following are explicitly prohibited:
- **Purchase or rental of cars, trucks, boats, or other vehicles** (including golf carts, ATVs, motorcycles)
- **Purchase of land or buildings**
- **Full or part payment of leases or rentals** (for real property)
- **Stocking a farm** (animals for animal husbandry purposes)

**Additional practical limitations:**
- Cannot receive cash directly -- must submit itemized lists for pre-approval
- Cannot purchase items before getting VRC approval
- Cannot retroactively claim expenses that were not pre-approved
- Cannot duplicate services available through other VA programs

### The Pre-Approval Requirement

**Every single purchase must be pre-approved by your VRC before you buy it.** This cannot be overstated. If you buy a $3,000 camera system without prior VRC approval, the VA will not reimburse you. The process is:

1. Identify what you need
2. Get specific quotes/prices
3. Submit itemized request to VRC with justification for each item
4. VRC reviews and approves (or denies)
5. VA procures the item directly or authorizes you to purchase with reimbursement
6. You receive the item

### Subsistence Allowance During Training

While you are in the training/planning phase, you receive a monthly subsistence allowance:

**FY2025 Rates (effective October 1, 2024):**

| Training Level | No Dependents | 1 Dependent | 2 Dependents | Each Additional |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Full-time | $812.84 | $1,008.24 | $1,188.15 | +$86.58 |
| Three-quarter | $612.57 | $756.10 | $892.37 | +$65.51 |
| Half-time | $412.30 | $503.96 | $594.23 | +$44.43 |

If you are eligible for Post-9/11 GI Bill, you may elect to receive the Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) rate instead, which is often higher depending on your location.

**Note:** Subsistence allowance is paid during business plan development, training courses, and the planning phase -- not indefinitely after business launch.

---

## 5. FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS

Per **38 CFR 21.257**, the VA must conduct a comprehensive feasibility analysis before authorizing a rehabilitation plan leading to self-employment. This is a regulatory requirement, not optional.

### Required Elements of the Feasibility Analysis

1. **Economic Viability Analysis**
   - Can this business realistically generate sufficient income?
   - What is the market demand for PI services in your geographic area?
   - What are competing PI firms charging?
   - What is the projected revenue in years 1-5?

2. **Cost Analysis**
   - Specifies the exact amount and types of assistance VA will provide
   - Itemized equipment list with costs
   - Training costs
   - Licensing costs
   - Total VA investment required

3. **Market Analysis**
   - Demand for PI services in your market area
   - Competition analysis (how many PIs operate in your region?)
   - Target clientele (attorneys, insurance companies, individuals, businesses)
   - Pricing strategy
   - Marketing plan

4. **Availability of Non-VA Financing**
   - Personal resources available
   - Local bank willingness to provide credit
   - SBA loan eligibility
   - Family/personal investment
   - The VA is not supposed to be the sole funding source -- they want to see you have skin in the game

5. **Evidence of SBA Coordination**
   - Required under Section 8 of the Small Business Act
   - SBA does not "approve" or "disapprove" the plan -- they provide an "acceptable" assessment
   - Work with your local SBDC to satisfy this requirement
   - Get the SBA review completed BEFORE submitting to VA

6. **Business Location Analysis**
   - Proposed location of the business (home office, commercial space)
   - Cost of the location
   - Zoning requirements
   - For a PI business, a home office is common and keeps costs low

7. **Training Plan**
   - What training is needed to operate the business successfully?
   - PI licensing courses
   - Business management training
   - Technology/software training
   - Timeline for completing training

### Who Conducts the Feasibility Analysis

The VRC leads the process, but external resources are involved:
- **SBDC** reviews the business plan
- **SCORE** mentors may provide input
- **VA Accelerator** program may be used for business concept development
- The VRC evaluates all inputs and makes a recommendation to the VREO

### How to Strengthen Your Feasibility Case for PI Work

**Demand indicators for PI services in Oregon:**
- Oregon has approximately 600+ licensed PIs (DPSST records)
- Rural Oregon (Eastern Oregon especially) has fewer PIs, meaning less competition
- Attorney demand for process service, witness location, and investigation
- Insurance fraud investigation is a growing market
- Corporate due diligence and background investigation
- Domestic/civil litigation support
- Worker's compensation fraud investigation

**Revenue projections for PI work:**
- Oregon PIs typically charge $50-$125/hour depending on service type
- Surveillance work: $75-$125/hour
- Process service: $50-$150 per serve
- Background checks: $150-$500 per report
- Insurance investigation: $75-$100/hour
- Retained attorney work: monthly contracts of $2,000-$10,000+

   - Financial summary

2. **Company Description**
   - Legal structure (sole proprietor, LLC)
   - Business location
   - Licenses and permits required
   - History/background

   - Corporate investigation
   - Asset searches

4. **Market Analysis**
   - Industry overview (PI industry trends)
   - Target market demographics and geography
   - Competition analysis (other PI firms in your area)
   - Market size and growth potential
   - Competitive advantages

5. **Marketing Plan**
   - How you will attract clients
   - Attorney networking strategy

   - Annual projections for Years 1-5
   - Startup cost breakdown (itemized)
   - Revenue projections
   - Expense projections
   - Break-even analysis
   - Profit/loss statements (pro forma)
   - Balance sheet (pro forma)

8. **Funding Request**
   - Total startup costs
   - What VA will fund
   - What personal resources contribute
   - What SBA or other financing covers

9. **Supporting Documents**
   - Three professional letters of reference
   - Resume
   - Market research data
   - Licensing requirements documentation
   - SBA/SBDC review letter
   - SCORE mentor assessment (if available)

### Presentation Tips

Per veteran forum advice:
- Organize materials with **tabs and a table of contents**
- Present professionally bound or in a quality binder
- Include **specific justifications** for every expensive item -- do not just list "camera - $2,000." Explain the model, why that specific model, what features are necessary for surveillance work, why a cheaper alternative is inadequate, and how it directly enables revenue generation
- Get the SBA/SBDC review completed before VA submission -- presenting a pre-reviewed plan shows initiative and competence

---

## 7. PI LICENSE FUNDING -- LEGAL BASIS AND COVERAGE

### Can VR&E Fund a PI License? YES.

**The legal basis is clear and explicit:**

**38 CFR 21.257(d)(3)** lists "license or required fees" as an authorized self-employment expense. This is not ambiguous -- licensing fees are specifically named in the regulation.

**The VA.gov website** confirms: "Tuition assistance to obtain needed certifications/licenses for the business" and "Financial assistance to cover applicable fees as well as related business startup costs."

**LaSorsa & Associates** (an investigation and security consulting firm that wrote specifically about VR&E) confirms: "VR&E can fund training for security or private investigator careers" when:
- The program is accredited or state-approved
- It directly aligns with the stated employment goal
- The veteran's disability does not prevent performing the duties
- The training leads to viable employment

They specifically list "security guard certification and private investigator training as qualifying programs."

### What VR&E Can Cover for PI Licensing

| Item | Coverable? | Regulatory Basis |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| PI training courses (DPSST-approved) | **YES** | 38 CFR 21.257(d)(1) -- vocational training |
| Oregon DPSST application fee ($74) | **YES** | 38 CFR 21.257(d)(3) -- license or required fees |
| Oregon DPSST licensing fee ($690) | **YES** | 38 CFR 21.257(d)(3) -- license or required fees |
| Fingerprinting / background check | **LIKELY** | 38 CFR 21.257(d)(3) -- required fees for licensure |
| Surety bond ($5,000 minimum) | **LIKELY** | Required for licensure under ORS 703.415(2)(b) |
| E&O insurance (in lieu of bond) | **LIKELY** | Required alternative under ORS 703.415(2)(b) |
| DPSST competency exam fees | **YES** | 38 CFR 21.257(d)(3) -- required fees |
| Continuing education (40 hrs provisional / 32 hrs full) | **YES** | 38 CFR 21.257(d)(1) -- training |
| Investigation equipment (cameras, etc.) | **YES** | 38 CFR 21.257(d)(4)-(5) -- tools and supplies |
| Computers and software | **YES** | General VR&E supply provision + 21.257(d)(4) |
| Surveillance equipment | **YES** | 38 CFR 21.257(d)(4) -- tools; justify in business plan |
| Business management training | **YES** | 38 CFR 21.257(d)(1) -- vocational training |
| Business insurance (general liability) | **POSSIBLE** | May fall under startup costs; present as required for operation |
| Professional association memberships | **POSSIBLE** | If required or strongly beneficial for business development |
| Office setup / home office equipment | **YES** | 38 CFR 21.257(d)(4)-(5) -- tools and supplies |
| Vehicle purchase or modification | **NO** | 38 CFR 21.214 -- explicitly prohibited |
| Office lease / rent | **NO** | 38 CFR 21.214 -- explicitly prohibited |

### Has VR&E Previously Funded PI Licensing?

No specific case study of a PI license funded through VR&E was found in publicly available forums or VA publications. However:

1. **LaSorsa & Associates** (a PI/security firm) specifically lists PI training as a qualifying VR&E program, strongly suggesting they have encountered or facilitated this
2. The regulatory language does not exclude PI work -- it authorizes any self-employment that passes the feasibility analysis
3. Security guard certification (a closely related field) is explicitly mentioned as a qualifying program
4. The 38 CFR 21.257 regulation is occupation-agnostic -- it covers any legal self-employment
5. Multiple veterans have reported getting funded for similarly service-oriented businesses (security consulting, IT consulting, photography)

**Bottom line:** There is no regulatory barrier to VR&E funding a PI license and business. The question is not WHETHER the VA can fund it -- the question is whether your VRC and VREO will APPROVE it based on feasibility.

## 9. THE PROVISIONAL LICENSE STRATEGY

Oregon offers a **Provisional Private Investigator license** that creates a clear pathway into the profession without requiring the 1,500 hours of experience upfront. This is the recommended strategy for VR&E.

### How the Provisional License Works

1. **No experience required** to obtain the provisional license (you must still pass the competency exam and meet all other requirements)
2. The provisional license allows you to **work for an Oregon PI agency** (not independently)
3. You perform the **same job functions** as a fully licensed PI
4. You **cannot supervise** other investigators
5. You **cannot operate independently** or run your own PI company with a provisional license
6. You accumulate **documented hours** toward the 1,500-hour requirement while working
7. Upon reaching 1,500 hours, you submit **Form PI-11** to upgrade to a full license
8. Higher CE requirement: 40 hours upon renewal (vs 32 for full PI)

### VR&E Strategy Using the Provisional License

**Phase 1: Training and Provisional Licensing (Months 1-6)**
- VR&E funds PI training courses (DPSST-approved)
- VR&E pays licensing fees ($764)
- VR&E pays fingerprinting and background check
- VR&E funds business management training
- Veteran studies for and passes DPSST competency exam
- Provisional license obtained

**Phase 2: Experience Accumulation (Months 6-18)**
- Work for an established Oregon PI firm under provisional license
- VR&E may support this as:
  - **On-the-Job Training (OJT)** -- VR&E subsidizes wages while employer trains you
  - **Non-Paid Work Experience (NPWE)** -- VR&E provides subsistence while you gain experience
  - Regular employment with subsistence supplement
- Accumulate 1,500 hours of documented experience
- Continue business plan development with SBDC/SCORE during this period
- Network with attorneys, insurance companies, potential clients

**Phase 3: Full License and Business Launch (Months 18-24)**
- Upgrade provisional license to full PI license (Form PI-11)
- VR&E procures approved equipment and supplies
- Launch independent PI business
- VR&E monitoring period begins (12-18 months)

### Why This Strategy Works for VR&E

1. **Demonstrates commitment:** You are not asking VA to fund a business with zero experience
2. **Reduces risk:** The provisional phase proves you can do the work before the business launches
3. **Satisfies feasibility:** By the time you launch, you have documented experience and client contacts
4. **Allows Category II start:** Training and provisional licensing costs are under $25,000, meaning faster regional approval while you build toward the full business
5. **Military experience credit:** ORS 703.415 explicitly allows military training and experience to count -- document your military background as applicable investigatory experience

## 10. PI BUSINESS EQUIPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY VR&E CAN PROVIDE

Below is a comprehensive list of equipment a PI business needs, with notes on VR&E fundability. All items must be justified in the business plan and pre-approved by the VRC.

| Office rental space | 38 CFR 21.214 -- lease/rental of real property prohibited |
| Ongoing subscription fees (long-term) | VR&E provides startup support, not indefinite funding |

**Workaround for vehicle:** Use your personal vehicle. VR&E cannot buy or modify a vehicle for business, but you can justify vehicle-related equipment (dash cam, GPS, magnet signs) as business tools.

## 11. HOW TO PRESENT THE PI BUSINESS CASE TO YOUR VRC

### Frame the Narrative Around Your Disability

The VRC's primary concern is: "Does self-employment overcome the employment barrier created by your service-connected disability?"

**Build your case around these points:**
1. Your disability limits traditional employment (explain specific functional limitations)
2. Self-employment allows schedule flexibility around medical appointments and flare-ups
3. PI work can be structured around your physical capabilities (desk research vs. field work ratio)
4. Working for yourself eliminates workplace accommodation barriers
5. You can scale workload up or down based on health status
6. PI work is within your Residual Functional Capacity (get your provider to document this)

### Demonstrate Market Viability

**Research your local market before the appointment:**
- How many PIs are licensed in your county/region? (Check DPSST database)
- What do local attorneys charge for PI services?
- Are there underserved areas with no local PI?
- What types of investigation are in demand? (Insurance fraud, domestic, legal support)
- Eastern Oregon likely has fewer PIs per capita than Portland metro -- this is an advantage

### Show You Have Done Your Homework

Bring to the appointment:
1. This research document (printed or on device)
2. Oregon DPSST licensing requirements (printed from their website)
3. A preliminary business concept outline (even 1-2 pages)
4. Local market research (PI firms in your area, attorney demand)
5. Revenue projections (even rough estimates)
6. Your service-connected disability documentation
7. Medical records or provider letter showing how disability creates employment barriers
8. Provider letter confirming PI work is within your Residual Functional Capacity
9. Knowledge of the regulations: cite 38 CFR 21.257 by name

### What to Say

**Opening:**
"I want to pursue the self-employment track under my VR&E benefits. My vocational goal is to become a licensed Private Investigator and operate my own investigation business. My service-connected disability creates barriers to traditional employment, but self-employment in investigation work is within my Residual Functional Capacity and allows me to accommodate my disability."

**When asked about feasibility:**
"I have researched the Oregon DPSST licensing requirements thoroughly. Oregon allows a provisional license pathway that lets me work under an established PI while building the 1,500 hours of experience needed for a full license. I am prepared to work with the SBDC and SCORE to develop a formal business plan. I understand the feasibility analysis requirements under 38 CFR 21.257 and am ready to provide all information needed."

**When asked about costs:**
"A PI business can be launched with relatively modest startup costs -- primarily licensing fees, training courses, basic surveillance equipment, a computer, and investigation software. Many PIs operate from home offices, keeping overhead minimal. I have researched specific equipment needs and costs and am prepared to submit an itemized budget."

**When asked about revenue:**
"PI services in Oregon command $50-$125 per hour depending on the type of investigation. My primary revenue streams would be [attorney support, insurance investigation, process service, background checks]. With even 20 billable hours per week at $75/hour, that is $78,000 annually in gross revenue."

### What NOT to Say

- Do NOT agree to pursue a degree program or traditional employment "first" with self-employment as a vague future goal
- Do NOT say the business is "just an idea" -- present it as researched and planned
- Do NOT be confrontational if the VRC pushes back -- remain professional, document everything in writing, and know your appeal rights
- Do NOT overstate your capabilities or understate your disability -- the disability is what qualifies you for VR&E
- Do NOT bring up equipment costs in the first meeting -- focus on the goal and feasibility first
- Do NOT volunteer information about personal finances or other income unless asked

---

## 12. THE VRC RELATIONSHIP -- WORKING EFFECTIVELY AND ESCALATING

### How the VRC System Works

Your Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) is your assigned case manager throughout the VR&E process. They have broad discretion over:
- Whether to recommend self-employment vs. other tracks
- What training and services to authorize
- What equipment to approve
- How to structure your rehabilitation plan
- Whether to recommend approval to the VREO

The VREO (VR&E Officer) is the VRC's supervisor at the Regional Office and has approval authority for Category II self-employment.

### Working Effectively with Your VRC

1. **Communication:** Respond promptly to all VRC requests. Notify them immediately of any changes in health, training progress, or business plans
2. **Documentation:** Keep copies of EVERYTHING. Every email, every signed form, every approval
3. **Professionalism:** Treat every interaction as a business meeting
4. **Preparation:** Do not show up to meetings empty-handed. Always have questions prepared, research ready, and progress documented
5. **Follow-up:** After every meeting, send a summary email to the VRC confirming what was discussed and what next steps were agreed upon. This creates a paper trail
6. **Patience:** The VR&E bureaucracy moves slowly. Budget frustration but do not take it out on the VRC

### VR&E Discourages Self-Employment -- Be Prepared

Multiple veterans report that VR&E counselors actively discourage the self-employment track. One veteran stated plainly: "VR&E highly discourages Veterans from selecting the Self-Employment Track." Another spent 3 years appealing to the Board of Veterans Appeals to get self-employment approved.

**Why VRCs resist self-employment:**
- It is more work for them (business plan review, SBA coordination, monitoring)
- Higher risk of failure compared to traditional employment
- Performance metrics may favor faster case closures (traditional employment closes faster)
- Genuine concern about veterans failing in business
- Unfamiliarity with the self-employment regulations and process

**How to overcome resistance:**
- Come prepared with research and a business concept
- Know the regulations better than they do (38 CFR 21.257)
- Have medical documentation supporting self-employment as the best option
- Frame it as medically necessary, not just preferred
- Get SBDC and SCORE involved early to show external validation
- Be persistent but professional

### Your Rights

Per 38 CFR and VA policy:
- You have the right to participate in developing your rehabilitation plan
- Your vocational goal should reflect your abilities, aptitudes, and interests
- You have the right to request a specific track if it is medically and vocationally appropriate
- You have the right to disagree with the VRC's recommendation

### If the VRC Does Not Support Self-Employment

**Escalation pathway (in order):**

1. **Discuss with VRC:** Ask them to explain their concerns in writing. Ask what specific criteria you are not meeting. Ask what you could provide to address their concerns.

2. **Request Administrative Review:** Ask for a review by the VREO or program manager at your Regional Office. They review the VRC's decision for errors. Should be completed within 90 days.

3. **Request a Different VRC:** You can request a counselor change. Contact your Regional VA Office or call 1-800-827-1000. Put the request in writing. This should NOT change your rehabilitation plan.

4. **Higher-Level Review (HLR):** A supervisor at the Regional Office reviews the decision with fresh eyes.

5. **Formal Appeal to Board of Veterans Appeals (BVA):** Submit VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal). This goes directly to the BVA in Washington DC, bypassing the Regional Office entirely. You can request a hearing.

6. **Get a Veterans Service Organization (VSO) Representative:** A VSO (DAV, VFW, American Legion, etc.), an independent claims agent, or a private attorney can advocate on your behalf. This is FREE through VSOs. They know the system and can push back effectively.

7. **File an Ethics Complaint:** If the VRC failed to properly consider your wishes while participating in your plan, you may file a complaint with the VA Ethics Office.

**You have ONE YEAR from the date of any decision letter to take action on steps 2-5.**

### Can You Request a Specific VRC?

You can request a change of VRC. You cannot typically choose a specific person, but you can request reassignment. Put the request in writing to:
- Your current VRC's supervisor (VREO)
- The Regional Office VR&E program manager
- Or call 1-800-827-1000

The VA will try to accommodate your request. Common reasons for VRC change:
- Personality conflict
- Communication breakdown
- Disagreement on vocational goal
- Lack of responsiveness
- Relocation to a different area

---

## 13. AFTER APPROVAL -- MONITORING, REPORTING, AND CLOSURE

### Monitoring Period

After your business launches:
- VA monitors for a **minimum of 1 year**
- Monitoring can extend up to **18 months** (maximum post-employment services period)
- **Face-to-face meetings** with VRC or case manager required at least **3 times per year** (Level 2 case management)
- Monthly follow-up during the initial **60-day post-employment period**

### Reporting Requirements

During the monitoring period:
- Provide regular updates on business performance
- Maintain and share financial records (balance sheets, profit/loss statements)
- Attend scheduled meetings with VRC
- Report any significant changes (health, business status, address)
- Demonstrate the business is operating and generating revenue

### Case Closure -- Successful Rehabilitation

For self-employment cases, closure happens when:
1. The business has been operating for at least **60 days** successfully
2. The VRC determines you are "suitably employed" through self-employment
3. The 60-day follow-up period is completed
4. The VRC declares you **"rehabilitated"**
5. Self-employment case closure uses **VAF 28-0962 (Checklist)**, not the standard closure form

**Note:** If you achieve suitable self-employment before the 18-month service period expires, the case can be closed after the 60-day follow-up, even if that extends past the 18-month mark.

### 18-Month Post-Employment Services Period

- You have **up to 18 months** of post-employment services from business launch
- During this period, you can receive additional counseling, guidance, and limited assistance
- If you need additional equipment or training to sustain the business, this is the window to request it
- The 18-month clock starts when you begin self-employment (business launch date)
- Once 18 months expires, the case is closed (either as rehabilitated or discontinued)

### What Happens at Case Closure

- Your VR&E case is formally closed
- You no longer receive subsistence allowance (this ended when training ended)
- You keep all equipment and supplies purchased through VR&E
- The equipment is YOURS -- you do not return it
- If the business continues to operate, you are done with VR&E
- If you need additional VA employment assistance in the future, you may be eligible to reapply

---

## 14. WHAT HAPPENS IF THE BUSINESS FAILS

### No Repayment Required

**VR&E benefits are GRANTS, not loans.** This is critical to understand:

- There is **NO repayment obligation** if the business fails
- You do **NOT** have to return equipment, supplies, or tools
- You do **NOT** have to repay training costs, licensing fees, or subsistence
- The VA absorbs the investment as part of the rehabilitation program
- This is fundamentally different from an SBA loan or private financing

### If You Stop Participating

If you fail to follow through with services or discontinue participation:
- The VRC may move your case to **"Interrupted" status**
- While in Interrupted status, the VRC **must continue to provide counseling** to help you determine appropriate next steps
- You are not immediately cut off
- You may be able to:
  - Resume the self-employment plan after addressing the interruption
  - Develop a new rehabilitation plan with a different goal
  - Transition to a different VR&E track (traditional employment, long-term services, etc.)

### If the Business Fails During Monitoring

- The VRC will work with you to determine next steps
- You may be able to modify the business plan
- You may be able to pursue additional training
- You may be able to transition to a different track
- The failure does NOT create a debt or penalty

### Can You Reapply for VR&E After Business Failure?

Potentially yes, if:
- You still have entitlement months remaining (out of 48)
- Your service-connected disability still creates an employment barrier
- You propose a viable new vocational goal
- You have not exhausted your VR&E eligibility

### Important Caveat

While there is no financial penalty for failure, repeated failed plans or lack of participation can result in:
- Case discontinuance (harder to reopen)
- Reduced credibility with VRCs in future applications
- Exhaustion of entitlement months on unsuccessful plans
- Difficulty getting approved for another self-employment plan

## 15. REAL-WORLD VETERAN EXPERIENCES FROM FORUMS

### Documented Cases from Veterans Benefits Network and Reddit

**Case 1: Coins and Bullion Sales Business (Las Vegas, 2016)**
- Veteran: 80% service-connected disability, unemployed 8+ months
- Category: Category I
- Process: Initial VR&E evaluation with contractor completed, followed by VA follow-up within 30 days
- Key detail: VRC rejected all traditional employment options (photography, history teaching) due to disability impact, accepting ONLY self-employment as a viable path
- Outcome: Moved forward with self-employment as primary vocational goal
- Lesson: When disability clearly precludes traditional employment, the VRC may actually prefer self-employment

**Case 2: Large-Scale Business ($50K-$80K range, Las Vegas, 2016)**
- Veteran requested $50,000-$80,000 in funding
- Category I assignment (due to cost level)
- Timeline: Expected 7-9 months for Category I funding approval
- Strategy: Obtained SBA and independent consultant reviews of business plan BEFORE submitting to VA
- Requirement: Business must be profitable within 7 months
- Lesson: Get external validation first; present a pre-vetted plan

**Case 3: Category II to Category I Upgrade (2022)**
- Veteran: Started as Category II
- Challenge: Wanted to upgrade to Category I for more comprehensive funding
- Requirement for upgrade: Current medical documentation, treatment plan, and medication list from provider
- Complication: VA medical staff were unfamiliar with VR&E documentation requirements
- Lesson: You may need to educate your medical provider about what the VRC needs

**Case 4: New Jersey Business (Category I)**
- Veteran completed 7 of 8 steps in the self-employment process
- Used Small Business Development Center at Rutgers University-Camden for business plan development
- Submitted plan to Central Office in Washington DC
- Expected 160-180 day decision timeline from Central Office
- Required five years of financial projections, letters of reference, resume, and comprehensive plan
- Lesson: The Central Office phase alone takes 5-6 months -- plan accordingly

**Case 5: Three-Year BVA Appeal (DrBLK)**
- Veteran spent 3 years fighting through the Board of Veterans Appeals to get self-employment approved
- Noted: "VR&E highly discourages Veterans from selecting the Self-Employment Track"
- Eventually approved through persistence and appeals
- Lesson: If you believe self-employment is right for you, do not give up at the first rejection. Use the appeals process.

### Key Advice from the Veteran Community

**On Business Plan Development:**
- "Justify expensive equipment choices with detailed explanations of quality, materials, and competitive advantages"
- Specify exactly WHY each item is needed, not just what it costs
- Example: Do not write "Nikon D7500 -- $1,200." Write "Nikon D7500 DSLR with 18-300mm lens -- $1,200. Required for surveillance photography at distances of 50-500 feet in varying light conditions. The D7500 offers ISO 100-51200 for low-light capability, 8fps burst shooting for capturing subjects in motion, and weather sealing for outdoor operations. Consumer-grade alternatives lack the autofocus speed and low-light performance required for professional surveillance."

**On VR&E Navigation:**
- Distinguish between vocational GOALS (overarching objective) and OBJECTIVES (education/training steps)
- Self-employment should be the GOAL, not an objective or stepping-stone within another vocational path
- If the VRC tries to frame it differently, politely insist on self-employment as the stated goal

**On Financial Considerations:**
- VA typically targets approximately $25,000 as an equipment threshold for Category II
- If receiving SSDI, be aware of Substantial Gainful Activity (SGA) limits on earned income
- Debt-free status and separate income streams strengthen applications
- Having personal investment in the business shows commitment

**On Documentation:**
- Maintain balance sheets and profit/loss statements from day one
- Get medical provider letters documenting functional capacity relative to business demands
- Keep copies of every communication with your VRC
- Follow up every meeting with a written summary email

## 16. TIPS FOR GETTING THE SELF-EMPLOYMENT TRACK APPROVED

### Before Your Appointment

1. **Get your medical documentation right.** Have your provider write a letter stating:
   - Your service-connected disability and functional limitations
   - Why traditional employment is difficult or unsuitable
   - Why self-employment accommodates your disability
   - That PI work is within your Residual Functional Capacity
   - Your current treatment plan and medications

2. **Research your local PI market.** Know:
   - How many licensed PIs are in your county/region
   - What services are in demand (attorneys, insurance companies)
   - What the going rates are
   - Whether there is an underserved niche you can fill

3. **Have a preliminary business concept.** Even a 1-2 page outline showing:
   - Services you will offer
   - Target market
   - Revenue projections (even rough)
   - Startup costs (even rough)
   - Why this business will succeed

4. **Know the regulations.** Be able to cite:
   - 38 CFR 21.257 (self-employment provision)
   - The feasibility analysis requirements
   - Your right to participate in plan development
   - Your appeal rights

5. **Contact SBDC and SCORE before the appointment.** Even a preliminary conversation shows initiative. Note the contact names and dates.

### During Your Appointment

6. **Frame everything around your disability.** VR&E exists because of your disability. Every argument should connect back to how self-employment overcomes your employment barrier.

7. **Do not accept a plan that does not list self-employment as the goal.** If the VRC suggests school first, OJT first, or traditional employment first, politely decline and restate your self-employment goal. You can agree to training OBJECTIVES (courses, licensing) that support the self-employment GOAL.

8. **Ask questions, do not make demands.** "What would you need from me to move forward with self-employment?" is better than "I want self-employment and that's final."

9. **Be patient and professional.** The VRC has seen veterans who are not serious. Demonstrate that you are different by being prepared, professional, and knowledgeable.

10. **Take notes.** Write down everything the VRC says, every concern they raise, and every next step they identify. This creates accountability.

### After Your Appointment

11. **Send a follow-up email within 24 hours.** Summarize the meeting, confirm next steps, and thank the VRC. This creates a paper trail.

12. **Complete every assignment promptly.** If the VRC asks for additional documentation, medical records, or a revised plan, deliver it within days, not weeks.

13. **Stay engaged with SBDC and SCORE.** These external partners validate your plan and strengthen your case.

14. **Document everything.** Keep a folder (physical and digital) with:
    - All VR&E correspondence
    - All meeting notes
    - All forms submitted
    - All medical documentation
    - Business plan drafts and revisions
    - SBA/SBDC/SCORE communications

15. **If denied, appeal.** You have one year. Use it. Many veterans succeed on appeal who were initially denied.

2. **Service-connected disability documentation** (rating decision, medical records)
3. **Medical records or provider letter** showing:
   - Specific functional limitations from disability
   - Why traditional employment is difficult
   - That PI work is within your RFC
   - Current treatment plan

### Opening Statement

"I appreciate you meeting with me. I have a service-connected disability that creates significant barriers to traditional employment, but I have identified a vocational goal that I believe is realistic, viable, and within my functional capacity.

I want to pursue the self-employment track under VR&E to become a licensed Private Investigator and operate my own investigation business in Oregon. I have thoroughly researched the Oregon licensing requirements through DPSST, the market for PI services in my area, and the VR&E self-employment process under 38 CFR 21.257.

I am prepared to work with the SBDC and SCORE to develop a formal business plan and to complete whatever training and feasibility analysis the VA requires. I believe this is the best path to overcome my employment barrier and achieve stable self-employment."

### Anticipated VRC Questions and Answers

**Q: "Why not traditional employment?"**
A: "My disability [describe specific limitations] makes traditional employment unreliable. I need schedule flexibility for medical appointments and health management. I need the ability to control my work environment and workload. Self-employment gives me that while still being productive and earning income."

**Q: "Do you have any experience in investigation?"**
A: "I have [describe any relevant experience -- military, security, research, analytical skills]. Oregon also allows a provisional PI license that lets me work under an established PI to gain the 1,500 hours of documented experience required for a full license. The statute also specifically credits relevant military training and experience."

**Q: "Self-employment has a high failure rate. Why would this succeed?"**
A: "PI work has several advantages: low overhead (home office), steady demand (attorneys and insurance companies always need investigators), recurring revenue from established client relationships, and geographic advantages in my area where PI services are underserved. I am committed to working with SBDC and SCORE to ensure the business plan is sound before launch."

**Q: "What will it cost?"**
A: "The initial phase -- training, licensing, and basic equipment -- would likely come in under $25,000, which I understand falls within Category II approval authority. I want to build the business methodically: get licensed, gain experience under a provisional license, and then launch the full business. This staged approach reduces risk and allows the business plan to be validated by real experience."

**Q: "Have you considered other careers?"**
A: "I have, and PI work is the best fit for my skills, experience, and disability. It leverages [analytical thinking, attention to detail, persistence, research skills, technology proficiency -- whatever applies from your background]. It allows me to work independently, set my own schedule, and build something sustainable."

### What NOT to Say

- Do NOT agree to a plan for school or traditional employment "first" -- insist on self-employment as the goal
- Do NOT say the business is "just an idea" -- present it as researched and planned
- Do NOT be confrontational if the VRC pushes back
- Do NOT overstate your capabilities or understate your disability
- Do NOT bring up specific equipment costs in the first meeting unless asked -- focus on the goal and feasibility
- Do NOT volunteer information about other income sources unless directly asked
- Do NOT sign anything you are not comfortable with -- ask to take forms home and review them

### If the VRC Says No

1. Ask them to put the denial in writing with specific reasons
2. Ask: "What would I need to provide to change this decision?"
3. Do NOT argue -- thank them professionally and leave
4. Within 24 hours, send a follow-up email summarizing the denial
5. Contact a VSO representative (DAV, VFW, American Legion) for assistance
6. File for Administrative Review within 1 year
7. If necessary, file a formal appeal to the Board of Veterans Appeals (VA Form 10182)
8. Remember: multiple veterans have won self-employment approvals on appeal after initial denial
