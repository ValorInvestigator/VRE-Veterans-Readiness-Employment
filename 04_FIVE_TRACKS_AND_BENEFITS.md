## PROGRAM OVERVIEW AND ELIGIBILITY

Veterans Readiness and Employment (VR&E), formerly called Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (Voc Rehab), is a Chapter 31 benefit that helps veterans and service members whose service-connected disability limits their ability to work or prevents them from working. The program offers five distinct service tracks, plus a wide range of supplemental benefits including monthly stipends, medical and dental care, equipment, and post-employment support.

**Governing Law:** 38 USC Chapter 31 (Sections 3100-3122); 38 CFR Part 21, Subpart A

**Program Purpose (per 38 USC 3100):** To provide eligible veterans with service-connected disabilities all services and assistance necessary to enable them to achieve maximum independence in daily living and, to the maximum extent feasible, to become employable and to obtain and maintain suitable employment.

### Maximum Entitlement

- **Up to 48 months** of full-time services (compared to 36 months under the GI Bill)
- Extensions beyond 48 months are possible when a Serious Employment Handicap (SEH) is found
- The 2-month Employment Adjustment Allowance after program completion does NOT count against the 48-month cap
- Prior GI Bill usage may count against this limit but can potentially be restored through retroactive induction

### Basic Eligibility Requirements

You must meet ALL of the following:

1. **Did not receive a dishonorable discharge**
2. **Have a VA service-connected disability rating of at least 10%**
3. **Have an employment handicap** -- your disability limits your ability to prepare for, obtain, or maintain suitable employment

### Disability Rating Thresholds

| Rating | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **20% or higher** | Must demonstrate an "employment handicap" (standard threshold) |
| **10% to 19%** | Must demonstrate a "serious employment handicap" (SEH) -- a more significant limitation on employment |

### Eligibility Window (Basic Period of Eligibility)

| Discharge Date | Time Limit |
|---|---|
| **Before January 1, 2013** | 12-year window from separation date OR date of first VA disability rating (whichever is later). Can be extended if SEH is found. |
| **On or after January 1, 2013** | **NO time limit on eligibility** |

### Active-Duty Service Members

- Can apply with a memorandum rating of 20% or higher with imminent departure
- Can apply while awaiting discharge due to severe illness or injury
- Severely injured active-duty members can access VR&E automatically before a disability rating is issued per the National Defense Authorization Act (PL 110-181)

### The Initial Evaluation Process

After applying, here is what happens:

1. **Orientation** -- Attend a session at your nearest VA Regional Office
2. **Assignment of Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC)** -- Your dedicated case manager throughout the program
3. **Comprehensive Evaluation** -- The VRC assesses your abilities, skills, interests, disabilities, and employment barriers
4. **Entitlement Determination** -- VRC determines whether you have an employment handicap (or SEH)
5. **Track Selection** -- Together with your VRC, you develop an Individualized Written Rehabilitation Plan (IWRP) selecting the appropriate track

---

## TRACK 1: REEMPLOYMENT (Return to Previous Employer)

### Purpose

Helps veterans return to the job they held before deployment and supports their employer in meeting the veteran's disability-related needs.

### Who This Track Is For

Veterans with a service-connected disability who:
- Want to go back to their former employer and former position
- Had a specific job prior to deployment that they can potentially return to
- Need workplace accommodations or employer support to resume that role

### Services Provided

- **Return-to-work coordination** -- VA works directly with your previous employer to facilitate your return
- **Workplace accessibility modifications** -- Physical modifications to your workspace coordinated through VA
- **Assistive technology and adaptive equipment** -- Devices and technology to help you perform your job duties
- **Employer consultation** -- VA contacts your employer directly to ensure they understand and can meet your disability-related needs
- **Job coaching and adjustment counseling** -- Ongoing support as you transition back into the position
- **Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC)** -- Assigned as your dedicated case manager throughout the process
- **Ongoing counseling and monitoring** -- Regular check-ins to ensure the placement is working

### USERRA Connection

Veterans are protected under the **Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA)**, 38 USC Chapter 43, which:

- **Prevents employers from disadvantaging** service members in their civilian careers due to military service
- **Requires employers to reemploy** returning service members in the position they would have held had they not been absent for military service (the "escalator principle")
- Guarantees the **same seniority, status, and pay** you would have earned
- Provides **protection against termination** without cause for up to one year after reemployment (180 days for service of 31-180 days)
- Your VRC can help you **understand your USERRA rights** and assist in enforcement if an employer is not complying
- USERRA complaints can be filed with the U.S. Department of Labor's Veterans' Employment and Training Service (VETS)

### Accommodations the VA Can Provide

- Workplace modifications for physical accessibility (ramps, modified workstations, ergonomic equipment)
- Assistive technology (screen readers, voice recognition software, specialized input devices)
- Adaptive equipment specific to your job duties
- Job coaching during the transition period
- Ongoing adjustment counseling
- Coordination with employer's HR department on reasonable accommodations

### Additional Programs Available Under This Track

- **Special Employer Incentives (SEI):** Financial incentive program that assists employers who hire eligible veterans facing employment challenges. Employers may receive reimbursement for a portion of the veteran's salary during a trial period.
- **Non-Paid Work Experience (NPWE):** Hands-on training opportunity for veterans who need practical work experience before or during reemployment

### Rehabilitation Standard

A veteran on the Reemployment track is considered "rehabilitated" when they have:
1. Completed the employment program
2. **Maintained suitable employment for a minimum of 60 days**

---

## TRACK 2: RAPID ACCESS TO EMPLOYMENT

### Purpose

For veterans who already possess the skills, education, and experience to compete in the job market and need assistance getting employed quickly in a suitable occupation.

### Who This Track Is For

- Separating service members transitioning to civilian employment
- Veterans with existing qualifications who need job search support rather than long-term training
- Veterans whose disabilities do not prevent them from working in fields where they already have experience
- Veterans who need minor skill gaps addressed (short-term training) but are otherwise job-ready

### Services Provided

- **Career counseling** -- Professional and vocational guidance to identify suitable occupations matching your skills and disability limitations
- **Comprehensive skills assessment** -- Evaluation of your abilities, transferable skills, and interests
- **Resume creation and professional editing** -- Full resume development services by employment specialists
- **Interview preparation and coaching** -- Mock interviews, behavioral interview training, and presentation coaching
- **Job search assistance** -- Tools, resources, databases, and direct support for finding suitable positions
- **Job readiness preparation** -- Overall readiness for the civilian employment market
- **Short-term training and certifications** -- When minor skill gaps need to be addressed to make you competitive (industry certifications, licensure preparation, technology skills)
- **Job placement services** -- Direct assistance connecting you with employers, including employer outreach
- **Veterans' Preference verification** -- Help determining if you qualify for federal hiring preferences and how to use them
- **Federal employment assistance** -- Guidance navigating USAJobs and the federal hiring process
- **Labor market analysis** -- Research into job availability, salary ranges, and growth projections for target occupations
- **Networking assistance** -- Connection to employer networks, veteran hiring programs, and professional organizations

### Additional Programs

- **Special Employer Incentives (SEI):** Financial incentive for employers to hire veterans -- can make you a more attractive candidate
- **Non-Paid Work Experience (NPWE):** For hands-on skill development in a real work environment
- **VetSuccess on Campus** resources at participating universities and colleges
- **Employment coordinators** at VA regional offices providing direct placement support
- **Employer outreach specialists** who maintain relationships with veteran-friendly employers

### Timeline Expectations

This is designed to be the **fastest track to employment**. The emphasis is on immediate job placement using your existing skill set, not extended education or training. Duration varies by individual circumstances but is significantly shorter than Track 4 (Long-Term Services). Expect weeks to a few months, not years.

---

## TRACK 3: SELF-EMPLOYMENT

### Purpose

Helps eligible veterans start and run their own business when self-employment is determined to be the best path to overcome their disability-related employment barriers.

### Who This Track Is For

Service members or veterans with a service-connected disability and an employment barrier who have the desire, skills, and drive to run a successful business, AND for whom traditional employment may not be feasible or suitable due to the nature of their disability.

### Requirements to Qualify for This Track

ALL of the following must be met:

1. Service-connected disability
2. Employment handicap or barrier related to that disability
3. Enrolled in VR&E
4. Demonstrated interest, aptitude, and capability for self-employment
5. Business concept must be viable and suitable given the veteran's disability
6. Self-employment must be determined to be the most appropriate vocational goal
7. Must successfully complete the feasibility study and business plan development process

### Services Provided

- **Analysis of your business concept** -- VA evaluates whether your business idea is viable given market conditions, your skills, and your disability
- **Business plan development assistance** -- Coordination services and hands-on help developing a comprehensive proposed business plan
- **Training in small-business operations** -- Management, marketing, financial management, accounting, and business law training
- **Marketing and financial assistance** -- Guidance on marketing strategies and financial planning for the business
- **Feasibility study guidance** -- Structured evaluation of the viability of your business concept
- **License and permit fees** -- Covered by VA as authorized under 38 USC 3104(a)(12)
- **Essential equipment and supplies** -- VA can purchase startup equipment necessary for the business
- **Minimum stocks of materials** -- Initial inventory and supplies to launch the business
- **Training course fees** -- For any business-related courses needed (small business management, bookkeeping, industry-specific training)
- **Guidance on obtaining adequate resources** -- Help identifying and securing all resources needed to implement the plan, including alternate funding sources
- **Referrals to Small Business Administration (SBA)** -- Connection to SBA resources, SCORE mentors, Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs), and veteran-specific business programs
- **Ongoing counseling during startup phase** -- Your VRC continues to support you as the business launches

### How the Feasibility Study Works

This is a critical step -- your business concept must pass feasibility review before VA will approve the self-employment plan.

**Step-by-step process:**

1. Your VRC provides you with a **Feasibility Study of the Business Concept Checklist** (Appendix H of the M28R manual)
2. The checklist contains **12 specific items** that must be addressed
3. You must address each of the 12 items **in the order listed on the form**
4. You complete the checklist and return it to your VRC
5. The VRC reviews your business plan and completed checklist
6. The VRC evaluates whether self-employment and the proposed business are viable options
7. If viable, a **Category determination** is made:
   - **Category I:** Most complex cases (higher cost, more complex business models) -- requires both VREO and Central Office approval
   - **Category II:** Less complex cases -- may begin IWRP/IEAP self-employment plan development upon VRC approval alone
8. If approved, the Individualized Written Rehabilitation Plan (IWRP) is developed with self-employment as the vocational goal

**What the feasibility study evaluates:**
- Market demand for your product or service
- Competition analysis
- Your relevant skills and experience
- Financial projections and break-even analysis
- Location and facility requirements
- Equipment and supply needs
- Regulatory requirements (licenses, permits, zoning)
- Funding sources and financial sustainability
- Your disability accommodations within the business model
- Long-term viability of the business concept

### Approval Levels for Funding

The level of approval required depends on the total cost of the self-employment plan:

| Cost Level | Approval Authority |
|---|---|
| **Up to approximately $25,000** | Local level (VRC and supervisor) |
| **$25,000 to approximately $75,000** | Regional level (VR&E Officer / VREO) |
| **Over approximately $75,000** | Central Office (Washington, DC) -- requires both VREO and CO approval |

### Maximum Amounts for Self-Employment Assistance

The VA does **not publish a hard statutory dollar cap** on self-employment assistance. However, important limitations exist:

- Rehabilitation Benefits (RB) funds are not subject to a strict budgetary limit but must be closely monitored and justified
- All expenditures must be documented in the approved business plan
- The VRC must determine that each expenditure is necessary and reasonable
- **When the veteran's business requires supplies or fees greater in amount than VA may authorize, the veteran is responsible for securing alternate funding sources**
- The source of alternate payment or resources must be identified in the business plan
- Higher-cost plans require higher levels of approval (see table above)
- The VA provides **startup support, not ongoing business funding** -- once the business is operational, VA support tapers off

### What VA Can Purchase for Your Business

- Essential equipment (computers, machinery, tools specific to the business)
- Initial inventory and supplies
- License and permit fees
- Software and technology
- Training courses
- Marketing materials (initial)
- Office equipment and furnishings (if justified)
- Accessibility modifications to a business location

### What VA Will NOT Provide

- Ongoing operational costs (rent, utilities, payroll after startup)
- Permanent business funding or loans
- Real estate purchases
- Franchise fees (in most cases -- though some have been approved on a case-by-case basis)
- Items not directly related to the veteran's rehabilitation goal

---

## TRACK 4: EMPLOYMENT THROUGH LONG-TERM SERVICES

### Purpose

Provides the education, training, or other services needed to help a veteran find work in a different field when their disability prevents them from returning to their previous occupation or career.

### Who This Track Is For

Veterans with service-connected disabilities and employment barriers who need significant education or training to become employable in a new career suited to their abilities and limitations. This is the track for veterans who need to start fresh with a new career direction.

### What Is Covered -- Tuition, Fees, and Education Costs

**THIS IS WHERE VR&E SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEEDS THE GI BILL:**

- **ALL tuition and fees** -- No cap like the GI Bill's state maximum. VA pays the **actual cost** of tuition approved in your rehabilitation plan. This means private university tuition, out-of-state tuition, and graduate program tuition can all be fully covered.

- **Lab fees, testing fees, activity fees** -- All required academic fees
- **Licensing and certification exam fees** -- Including professional exam costs (bar exam, board exams, etc.)
- **Equipment and training materials** -- Anything determined necessary for the program

### Computer and Technology Provided

VR&E can provide technology when determined necessary for your training program:

- **Laptop or desktop computer** -- VA can purchase a computer for your educational needs
- **Software** -- Required software for coursework (Microsoft Office, specialized software for your field, etc.)
- **Printer** -- If needed for your program
- **Assistive technology** -- Adaptive software and hardware (screen readers, voice recognition, specialized input devices, magnification software)

- **Internet service** -- May be covered if required for your program and not otherwise available
- **Peripheral devices** -- As needed for your training (external monitors, drawing tablets, etc.)

**Important:** All technology purchases must be pre-approved by your VRC. Equipment provided by VA remains VA property until you complete rehabilitation, at which point it transfers to you.

### Tutoring Services

- **Tutorial assistance** is specifically authorized under 38 USC 3104(a)(5) and coordinated by your VRC/case manager
- Tutoring is provided as needed to help you succeed academically

- Extensions possible with SEH determination
- Prior GI Bill usage may count against this limit but can potentially be restored
- Part-time attendance extends the calendar duration proportionally

---

## TRACK 5: INDEPENDENT LIVING

### Purpose

For veterans whose disabilities are so severe that they cannot work immediately, this track helps them achieve maximum independence in daily living, home, family, and community.

### Who Qualifies

ALL THREE of the following must be met:

1. **Serious Employment Handicap (SEH)** -- Service-connected disability significantly limits the veteran's ability to prepare for, obtain, and maintain suitable employment
2. **Disabilities prevent return to work** or active job searching at this time -- the veteran cannot currently achieve a vocational goal
3. **Need for services** to live more independently in family and community -- there must be identifiable goals where independence can be improved

**Key point:** Independent Living is not a permanent alternative to employment. It is designed for veterans who cannot work NOW, with the understanding that some may eventually transition to an employment-focused track.

### Services Provided

**Evaluation and Planning:**
- Comprehensive evaluation of functional limitations and daily living barriers
- Development of an **Individualized Independent Living Plan (IILP)** -- a custom plan created with your VRC identifying specific independence goals
- Ongoing counseling and case management

**Assistive Technology:**
- Specialized equipment to overcome functional limitations
- Adapted computers and software (screen readers, voice recognition, magnification)
- Motorized wheelchairs and mobility devices
- Communication devices
- Environmental control systems (smart home technology for accessibility)
- Telecommunications aids (amplified phones, TTY devices, video relay equipment)
- Sensory aids (visual and auditory assistance devices)
- Any other technical aids determined necessary for independent living

**Home Modifications:**
- **Home adaptation assessment** -- VR&E evaluates your home and determines needed modifications
- **Doorway widening** for wheelchair access
- **Ramps** (interior and exterior)
- **Bathroom modifications** -- roll-in showers, grab bars, raised toilets, accessible sinks
- **Kitchen modifications** -- lowered counters, accessible appliances, modified cabinetry
- **Stair lifts or elevators** where justified
- **Flooring modifications** for mobility
- **Lighting improvements** for visual impairments
- **Other structural modifications** as identified in the IILP

**Adaptive Housing Grants -- Assessment and Referral:**
- VR&E can coordinate with and refer you to the **Specially Adapted Housing (SAH)** grant program (up to approximately $109,986 in FY2024)
- VR&E can coordinate with the **Special Housing Adaptation (SHA)** grant program (up to approximately $44,299 in FY2024)
- These are separate VA programs but your VRC can facilitate access

**Daily Living Skills Training:**
- Bathing, dressing, grooming, and personal care techniques
- Cooking and meal preparation
- Household management
- Community access and navigation
- Money management and budgeting
- Social interaction skills
- Time management
- Use of public transportation

**Community Integration Support:**
- Reducing reliance on caregivers and family members
- Connection to community resources and support networks
- Volunteer opportunities
- Social activities and programs
- Recreational therapy referrals

**Other Services:**
- Referrals to additional VA and community support resources
- Counseling services -- vocational, psychological, and personal adjustment
- Family counseling when it supports the veteran's independence goals
- Connection to peer support programs

### Duration

- Up to **24 months** of Independent Living services
- Extensions are possible in some cases when additional time is needed to meet IILP goals
- Can run concurrently with planning for eventual transition to an employment-focused track

### Annual Admission Cap

Federal law (38 USC 3120) limits new admissions to the Independent Living track to **2,700 veterans per year** nationally. This is a statutory cap on new entrants, NOT a cap on services for those already in the program.

### Approval Levels for Independent Living Plans

| Cost Level | Approval Authority |
|---|---|
| **Up to $25,000** | Local level (VRC and supervisor) |
| **$25,000 to $75,000** | Regional level (VR&E Officer / VREO) |
| **Over $75,000** | Central Office (Washington, DC) |

### Important Notes

- Independent Living services are **not intended to be permanent** -- the goal is to achieve specific, measurable independence objectives
- Some veterans may eventually transition from Independent Living to an employment-focused track as their condition improves
- Your VRC may coordinate Independent Living services alongside long-term employment planning
- There is no specific dollar cap on individual services within an approved IILP, but each item must be justified and approved at the appropriate level

---

## ADDITIONAL BENEFITS ACROSS ALL TRACKS

These benefits are available to veterans participating in ANY of the five VR&E tracks, as applicable to their rehabilitation plan.

### Subsistence Allowance (Monthly Stipend) -- FY2026 Rates

**Effective October 1, 2025** (2.5% CPI increase from FY2025)

This is a **TAX-FREE monthly stipend** paid **ON TOP OF** your existing VA disability compensation. It does not reduce or replace your disability pay.

**Institutional Training (College, University, Trade School, Technical School):**

| Attendance Rate | No Dependents | 1 Dependent | 2 Dependents | Each Additional Dependent |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Full-Time** | $812.84 | $1,008.24 | $1,188.15 | +$86.58 |
| **3/4 Time** | $610.76 | $757.28 | $888.32 | +$66.60 |
| **1/2 Time** | $408.66 | $506.32 | $595.16 | +$44.42 |
| **1/4 Time*** | $204.30 | $253.20 | $297.59 | +$22.16 |

*Quarter-time rate available ONLY during Extended Evaluation period

**Farm Cooperative, Apprenticeship, and Other On-Job Training:**

| Attendance Rate | No Dependents | 1 Dependent | 2 Dependents | Each Additional Dependent |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Full-Time** | $710.67 | $859.43 | $990.47 | +$64.41 |

**Non-Pay / Nominal Pay On-Job Training and Independent Instruction:**

| Attendance Rate | No Dependents | 1 Dependent | 2 Dependents | Each Additional Dependent |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Full-Time** | $812.84 | $1,008.24 | $1,188.15 | +$86.58 |

**Combined Training Programs:**

| Type | No Dependents | 1 Dependent | 2 Dependents | Each Additional Dependent |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Institutional > 1/2** | $812.84 | $1,008.24 | $1,188.15 | +$86.58 |
| **On-Job > 1/2** | $710.67 | $859.43 | $990.47 | +$64.41 |

**Maximum Monthly Rate:** **$3,439.23** (full-time with multiple dependents)

**CRITICAL -- Post-9/11 GI Bill BAH Election:**
If you have ANY remaining Post-9/11 GI Bill entitlement, you can elect to receive the **E-5 with dependents BAH rate** based on your school's ZIP code instead of the standard Chapter 31 rates above. In most medium- and high-cost areas, the Post-9/11 rate is SIGNIFICANTLY higher -- potentially $2,000-$4,000+ per month depending on location. **Ask your VRC to calculate both options and elect the higher one.**

Note: Electing the Post-9/11 BAH rate while using VR&E will consume Post-9/11 entitlement for the housing portion, but your tuition remains covered by Chapter 31 (no state cap).

### Transportation Assistance

Per 38 USC 3104(a)(13):

- **Travel and incidental expenses** covered to and from your training site, school, or workplace

## VR&E VS. GI BILL COMPARISON

This is one of the most important things to understand before your appointment. VR&E and the GI Bill are separate programs with significant differences.

| Feature | VR&E Chapter 31 | Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33) |
|---|---|---|
| **Entitlement Duration** | Up to **48 months** | Up to **36 months** |
| **Tuition Coverage** | **Actual cost paid -- NO state cap** | Capped at state maximum for public schools; private school cap of ~$28,937/year (FY2025) |
| **Housing Allowance** | Subsistence allowance (national rates above) OR Post-9/11 BAH rate if eligible | BAH E-5 with dependents based on school ZIP code |
| **Books/Supplies** | **ALL necessary books/supplies covered -- no annual cap** | Up to $1,000/year flat amount |
| **Computer/Technology** | **Can be provided if determined necessary** | Not provided |
| **Dental Coverage** | **Yes -- when necessary for rehabilitation** | No |
| **Medical Referrals** | **Yes -- to VHA and contract providers** | No |
| **Prosthetics** | **Yes -- when necessary for rehabilitation** | No |
| **Transportation** | **Yes -- including special transportation allowance** | No |
| **Disability Rating Required** | Yes (minimum 10%) | No |
| **Employment Handicap Required** | Yes | No |
| **Dedicated Counselor (VRC)** | **Yes -- assigned case manager** | No dedicated counselor |
| **Post-Program Employment Support** | **Yes -- up to 18 months** | No |
| **Employment Adjustment Allowance** | **Yes -- up to 2 months extra pay** | No |
| **Transferable to Dependents** | No | Yes (with conditions) |
| **Work-Study Eligible** | Yes | Yes |
| **Tutoring** | **Yes -- coordinated by VRC** | Limited |
| **Licensing/Certification Exams** | **Covered in full** | Separate program (up to $2,000) |
| **Tools/Equipment** | **Covered when necessary** | Not covered |
| **Clothing Allowance** | **Yes -- when necessary** | No |

### Critical Advantages of VR&E Over the GI Bill

1. **12 more months of entitlement** (48 vs 36)
2. **No tuition cap** -- private universities, graduate programs, and professional schools fully covered
3. **No book/supply cap** -- everything you need is paid for
4. **Computer and technology provided** -- the GI Bill does not do this
5. **Dental and medical coverage** during the program
6. **Dedicated VRC counselor** managing your entire plan
7. **18 months of post-employment support** -- the GI Bill ends when school ends
8. **2-month Employment Adjustment Allowance** after completing the program
9. **Transportation assistance** including special disability-related transportation

### Using Both Programs Together

- If eligible for BOTH VR&E and Post-9/11 GI Bill, you can elect the **higher housing rate** (usually the Post-9/11 BAH)
- **Using VR&E first does NOT consume your GI Bill entitlement** for tuition purposes
- However, electing the Post-9/11 BAH rate for housing WILL consume Post-9/11 entitlement at a proportional rate
- Your VRC can calculate both options and help you maximize your total benefits
- Some veterans use VR&E for their primary education and save GI Bill benefits for additional training or transfer to dependents

## WHAT TO BRING TO YOUR APPOINTMENT

### Documents

1. **DD-214** (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty)
2. **VA disability rating letter** -- or at minimum, know your current rating percentage
3. **Medical records** relevant to your service-connected disabilities -- especially anything showing how the disability affects your ability to work
4. **Resume or employment history** -- even an informal list of jobs, skills, and dates
5. **Education transcripts** -- high school, college, military training records (JST/Joint Services Transcript)
6. **Military training records** -- certificates, MOS/AFSC documentation, professional military education
7. **Civilian certifications or licenses** -- anything currently held
8. **Dependent information** -- names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers for spouse and children (this affects your subsistence allowance rate)

### Information to Have Ready

9. **Your vocational goals** -- think about which track interests you most and what career you want to pursue
10. **Your limitations** -- be prepared to honestly discuss how your disability affects your ability to work, train, and function day-to-day
11. **Your work history** -- be ready to discuss what you did before, during, and after military service
12. **Your education history** -- what have you already completed?
13. **Schools or programs of interest** -- if you are considering Track 4, research some programs in advance
14. **Business concept** -- if you are considering Track 3, have at least a basic idea of what business you want to start

### Questions to Ask Your VRC

15. **This briefing or notes from it** -- reference it during your meeting
16. Specific questions you want answered:
    - "Which track do you think is the best fit for my situation?"
    - "Can I receive the Post-9/11 GI Bill BAH rate instead of the Chapter 31 subsistence allowance?"
    - "What is the timeline for getting approved and starting my program?"
    - "How do I request a computer/laptop for my training program?"
    - "Am I eligible for dental treatment under Chapter 31?"
    - "What happens if I need to change my vocational goal mid-program?"
    - "Can I attend school out of state or online?"
    - "What is the process for getting a program extension beyond 48 months?"

## KEY STRATEGIC POINTS

These are the things to remember and advocate for during your appointment:

1. **VR&E pays for everything the GI Bill pays for, PLUS significantly more** -- dental, medical referrals, computers, tools, transportation, 18 months of post-employment support, and no tuition cap.

2. **Your GI Bill entitlement is preserved** -- using VR&E first does NOT consume your GI Bill for tuition. You can save GI Bill benefits for later use or transfer to dependents.

3. **You can elect the higher housing rate** -- if you have Post-9/11 GI Bill eligibility, you can get the BAH rate instead of the flat Chapter 31 subsistence rate. In most areas, this is dramatically more money per month.

4. **The subsistence allowance is TAX-FREE** and paid ON TOP OF your disability compensation. It is additional income, not a replacement.

5. **48 months beats 36 months** -- VR&E gives you a full year more of entitlement than the GI Bill.

6. **No tuition cap** -- unlike the GI Bill's state maximum, VR&E pays actual tuition costs. This matters enormously for private schools, graduate programs, and professional degrees.

7. **You get a dedicated counselor (VRC)** who manages your entire rehabilitation plan. This is someone in your corner navigating the system with you.

8. **The 2-month Employment Adjustment Allowance does NOT count against your 48 months** -- it is extra pay after you graduate, while you are job searching.

9. **18 months of post-employment support** means the VA does not abandon you after graduation. Your VRC stays on your case until you are established in your career.

10. **Ask for EVERYTHING** -- computer, software, books, tools, equipment, dental work, transportation. If it is related to your rehabilitation, it can potentially be covered. The worst they can say is no. Do not leave benefits on the table.

11. **Document your employment handicap thoroughly** -- the more clearly you can explain how your disability limits your ability to work, the stronger your case for approval. Be honest and detailed.

12. **You are not locked into one track forever** -- if your circumstances change, your rehabilitation plan can be modified. If you start on one track and it is not working, talk to your VRC about changing direction.

13. **If denied, you can appeal** -- an initial denial is not the end. You have the right to appeal under 38 CFR Part 19 and 20.

14. **Request everything in writing** -- any decision, denial, or plan should be documented. Keep copies of everything.
