## Know What Your Counselor Is Supposed To Do

- **CRCC Ethics Code Section A** — Counselors must empower clients to make their own decisions
- **CRCC Ethics Code Section C** — Counselors MUST advocate at individual, group, and institutional levels
- **GAO-20-28 (2019)** — VR&E plans vary by counselor with no mechanism to detect inconsistency
- **VA OIG 23-00967-64 (2024)** — Counselors "generally unaware" of regulations, bypassed system controls
- **M28R/M28C manuals** — Internal procedures your VRC follows (or should be following)
- **Counselor caseload: 240+ cases each** — they're overwhelmed, which is why you need to advocate for yourself

## Key Regulations Every Veteran Should Know

- **38 CFR 21.53** — *"Any reasonable doubt shall be resolved in favor of a finding of feasibility"*
- **38 CFR 21.257(d)(3)** — VA pays for *"license or required fees"* under self-employment
- **38 CFR 21.362/21.364** — VA must follow a 3-step process before discontinuing you
- **38 CFR 21.420(e)** — Favorable findings are **binding** on subsequent adjudicators
- **38 USC 3104(a)(15)** — Services include "other appropriate services" (the catch-all)

## Who This Is For

- Veterans preparing for a VR&E initial appointment
- Veterans who were denied and need to appeal
- Veterans pursuing self-employment or professional licensing
- Veteran advocates and VSO representatives
- Anyone who wants to understand what the VA actually owes under Chapter 31

## Disclaimer

This is research compiled from public law (38 USC), public regulations (38 CFR), VA policy manuals, and official VA sources. It is not legal advice. But it is the truth — and the truth is your best weapon at that appointment.
