# 15. Real-World VR&E Case Study: The 19-Minute Intake

> This is a genericized account of an actual VR&E intake evaluation in February 2026. All identifying information has been removed. The purpose is to show veterans what a real meeting looks like, what went wrong, and why the preparation — not the meeting — is what matters.

## The Setup

A veteran rated 100% P&T for PTSD with polysubstance use disorder applied for VR&E Chapter 31, seeking Track 4 (Employment Through Long-Term Services) to complete a bachelor's degree in a field related to fraud examination and investigations. The veteran had:

- 80+ college transfer credits already completed
- 18 months of documented volunteer investigative work
- Proven results: a DOJ petition, a CMS investigation, work with federal law enforcement
- A clear career goal with high labor market demand (88% of employers need AI-proficient fraud examiners, only 18% have them)
- A supplemental package including: labor market analysis, training plan, accommodation strategy (remote work), and documented volunteer work history

The veteran submitted the supplemental package the night before the meeting.

## What Happened

The intake evaluation was scheduled for a two-hour block. It lasted **18 minutes and 40 seconds**.

### Minutes 1-5: Entitlement (Quick Win)

The VRC acknowledged the veteran's preparation immediately. She had reviewed the submitted materials and found them thorough. She granted entitlement within the first few minutes:

> *"You do meet entitlement criteria with your rating percentage and also proving that there's an employment handicap and even what we would determine as a significant employment handicap."*

**Lesson:** When your package is solid, entitlement should be fast. The VRC even said she didn't need to gather more information. The supplemental materials did the work.

### Minutes 5-10: The Feasibility Wall

Immediately after granting entitlement, the VRC pivoted to feasibility — and the tone changed:

> *"At this time, determining feasibility of any goal is really difficult just based on what it says in the narrative."*

She focused on the VA disability narrative (which describes the veteran's worst-case functional limitations) and applied it as a blanket barrier to all employment. Key statements:

- "We can't just approve a goal where it's carved out — where you can work on what you want, when you want, where you want."
- "The evidence that I do have unfortunately just doesn't support feasibility at this time."
- "It's hard to justify that any job would not exacerbate the service-connected disability."

**What was happening:** The VRC read the 100% PTSD rating, read the disability narrative's language about "difficulty adapting to work," and decided before the meeting that no vocational goal was feasible. She came in with her mind made up.

### Minutes 10-15: The Veteran Pushes Back

The veteran presented counter-evidence in real time:

1. **Market demand:** 400+ current remote job postings on Indeed alone, 88% employer demand for AI-proficient fraud examiners, BLS data showing 30%+ growth
2. **Proven work capacity:** 18 months of volunteer investigative work including federal-level results
3. **Accommodation fit:** Remote work eliminates the environmental triggers described in the disability narrative
4. **The credential gap:** "The only thing that stops me from being able to get those jobs is because I don't have a degree."

The VRC offered an extended evaluation instead — which would require "reporting to work" in settings the veteran had already explained would aggravate their conditions.

### Minutes 15-19: The Close

When it became clear the VRC had already decided, the veteran pivoted to the most important move:

> *"Can you please provide me the decision, or what you need to do, in writing with specific regulations you're relying on, as required by 38 CFR 21.420?"*

The veteran also put the VRC's approach on the record:

> *"I feel like you came into this with your mind made up, unfortunately, because you read it, you saw the 100%."*

The VRC agreed to provide the written decision. The meeting ended.

## What the VRC Got Wrong

### 1. Conflating Rating with Incapacity
A 100% PTSD rating does not mean a veteran cannot work. It means the disability significantly impairs employment in traditional settings. Under 38 CFR 21.52, this actually qualifies the veteran for a Serious Employment Handicap — which means **more** services, not fewer.

### 2. Using the Narrative as a Blanket Denial
The disability narrative describes functional limitations in general terms ("difficulty adapting to work"). The VRC applied this as if it said "cannot perform any work in any setting." It does not. A career in remote fraud examination operates in a controlled environment that specifically avoids the triggers described in the narrative.

### 3. Failing to Apply the Feasibility Standard
Under 38 CFR 21.53(d), infeasibility requires "compelling evidence beyond reasonable doubt." The VRC cited no evidence that met this standard. She cited the rating and the narrative — neither of which constitutes compelling evidence that a specific remote career goal is infeasible.

### 4. Ignoring 18 Months of Evidence
The veteran had 18 months of documented work product, professional references, federal agency engagement, and proven capability. The VRC acknowledged this but dismissed it because the work was done on a flexible schedule. Thousands of remote fraud examiner positions operate on flexible schedules.

### 5. Pre-Deciding the Outcome
The meeting was scheduled for two hours. It lasted 19 minutes. The VRC's own acknowledgment — "I feel pretty well informed about what specific it is you're looking for... that just honestly kind of saves us some time" — shows she came in having already decided. She was not evaluating feasibility; she was delivering a decision.

## Why the Preparation Won

The meeting was lost before it started. But the **appeal** was won before the meeting started. Here's why:

### 1. The Supplemental Package Is on File
Everything the veteran submitted is now part of the VA record. The labor market analysis, training plan, accommodation strategy, and documented work — the VRC cannot claim this evidence was never presented.

### 2. The VRC's Own Words Are on Record
The veteran recorded the meeting (in a one-party consent state). Every statement the VRC made — including acknowledging the evidence was thorough and then denying feasibility anyway — is preserved.

### 3. The Written Decision Will Expose the Errors
By demanding the written decision per 38 CFR 21.420, the veteran forced the VRC to commit her reasoning to paper. Written denials must cite specific regulations and evidence. Vague reasoning that sounds plausible in a conversation often falls apart when it has to be written down.

### 4. The Appeal Path Is Clear
- **Higher-Level Review (VA Form 20-0996):** The VRC clearly misapplied the feasibility standard. She cited the rating and narrative but did not meet the "compelling evidence beyond reasonable doubt" threshold.
- **Key evidence for appeal:** The veteran's documented work capacity, the market analysis, the accommodation plan, and the VRC's own admission that entitlement was met immediately.

## The Lessons

1. **Submit your package the night before, not weeks before.** The VRC used the submission time to pre-decide the outcome. Submitting closer to the meeting limits their preparation time while ensuring they see you came prepared.

2. **The meeting is not where you win.** The meeting is where you get your evidence on the record and force the VRC to commit their reasoning to paper. Win or lose, you are building a file.

3. **Know the exact phrase.** When it goes sideways, say: *"Please provide me the decision in writing, including the specific regulations you are relying on, as required by 38 CFR 21.420."* This is the single most important sentence you will say.

4. **Have your materials at your desk.** The veteran had the appeal guide, CFR citations, and counter-arguments within arm's reach. When the VRC challenged feasibility, the veteran cited market data and 38 CFR 21.53(d) in real time.

5. **A 100% rating is an asset, not a barrier.** It guarantees Serious Employment Handicap, which unlocks unlimited months of training and additional support. Any VRC who says "your rating is too high" is wrong.

6. **Record everything your state allows.** The VRC's statements in this meeting are now evidence in the appeal.

7. **The appeal is where you win.** The feasibility standard under 38 CFR 21.53(d) — "compelling evidence beyond reasonable doubt" — is nearly impossible for the VA to meet when the veteran has documented work capacity and a clear career goal. This veteran's appeal is strong precisely because the meeting was handled correctly.
