# 1. THE M28R/M28C POLICY MANUAL

## 1.1 What Is the VR&E Policy Manual?

The VR&E policy manual is the internal VA document that governs every aspect of the Veterans Readiness and Employment program. It tells Vocational Rehabilitation Counselors (VRCs) how to evaluate eligibility, develop rehabilitation plans, authorize services, approve self-employment, handle disputes, and manage every step of a veteran's case. Understanding this manual gives a veteran significant leverage because they can cite chapter and verse when a counselor makes a decision that contradicts VA's own written policy.

## 1.2 M28R vs. M28C -- The Transition

**M28R (Old Manual):**
- Full title: "Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Service Manual"
- Published in segments over many years, with individual chapters as separate PDF and Word documents
- Hosted on WARMS (Web Automated Reference Material System) at benefits.va.gov/warms/
- Extremely difficult to navigate -- over 100 separate downloadable files with no search function
- Last updated in various pieces through 2020

**M28C (Current Manual):**
- Full title: "Veteran Readiness and Employment Manual"
- Effective date: October 1, 2020, when M28R was formally rescinded and replaced
- NOT just a relabel -- the M28C is a substantive rewrite of the entire policy manual
- Moved from WARMS to the KnowVA Knowledge Base platform
- KnowVA provides keyword search, hyperlinked cross-references, and a navigable table of contents
- Template decision letters and internal guidance documents that were previously unavailable to the public are now included in M28C
- The transition was done quietly -- there was no press release or formal public announcement

**What Changed in the Content:**
- Language updated throughout to reflect "Veterans Readiness and Employment" instead of "Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment"
- "Employment handicap" used throughout M28R; M28C began transitioning toward "employment barrier" (this will become official statute language if the VERY Act of 2025 passes)
- Internal counselor decision-making procedures rewritten
- Case management policies modernized
- Template letters and forms included that were previously internal-only
- Digital-first approach rather than downloadable PDFs

## 1.3 Where to Access the M28C

**Official Location:**
- KnowVA Knowledge Base: https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018/content/554400000143195/M28C-Table-of-Contents
- Requires JavaScript to load
- Can be accessed without a VA login (public-facing)

**Legacy M28R Content (Still Available for Reference):**
- WARMS: https://benefits.va.gov/warms/topic-vocational-rehabilitation.asp
- Many of the old M28R PDFs are still hosted and downloadable
- Useful for comparison and for citing specific provisions that may not have changed substantively

**Unofficial Sources:**
- A Kindle/paperback version of the M28R was published by Bradley Angle (Amazon, 2023) but is unofficial and may not reflect M28C changes
- Various veteran advocacy sites host excerpts

## 1.4 M28C Manual Structure

The manual is organized into multiple Parts covering the full lifecycle of a VR&E claim:

| Part | Coverage |
|------|----------|
| Part I | Introduction, general policies, program overview |
| Part II | Initial evaluation, eligibility determination, entitlement decisions |
| Part III | Case management, rehabilitation planning, counselor responsibilities |
| Part IV | Services: training, employment assistance, self-employment, independent living |
| Part V | Supplies, equipment, and other program support (dollar thresholds, authorization procedures) |
| Part VI | Self-employment specifics (Chapter 9 is the critical self-employment chapter) |

### Key Chapters for Self-Employment:
- **Part VI, Section A, Chapter 9:** Self-Employment -- defines Category I/II/III, business plan requirements, approval authorities, feasibility assessments
- **Part V, Chapter 4, Section A:** Supplies and Equipment -- defines what VA can purchase, dollar limits, authorization procedures
- **Part IV, Section C, Chapter 8:** Employment services and tracks

## 1.5 Key Policy Manual Provisions Veterans Should Know

**Entitlement Determination (Part II):**
- A veteran must have a service-connected disability rated at least 10% AND an "employment handicap" (soon to be "employment barrier")
- A 20% or higher rating creates a rebuttable presumption of an employment barrier
- The VRC must conduct an initial evaluation to determine if the disability creates a barrier to obtaining or maintaining suitable employment

**Rehabilitation Plan (Part III):**
- Once eligible, the veteran and VRC develop an Individualized Written Rehabilitation Plan (IWRP)
- The veteran has the right to participate in plan development
- The plan must identify a specific vocational goal
- Both the veteran and VRC sign VAF 28-8872 (Rehabilitation Plan)

**Services Authorization (Part IV-V):**
- VR&E can authorize tuition, fees, books, supplies, equipment, subsistence allowance, and other services
- Equipment purchased by VA may remain VA property
- Dollar thresholds exist above which higher-level approval is required

**Self-Employment (Part VI Chapter 9):**
- Covered in detail in Section 6 below

# 2. RECENT LEGISLATION (2020-2026)

## 2.1 Johnny Isakson and David P. Roe, M.D. Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act of 2020

**Public Law 116-315 (H.R. 7105), signed January 5, 2021**

This is the law that renamed the program. Key VR&E provisions:

- **Section 1001:** Changed the program name from "Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment" to "Veterans Readiness and Employment" throughout Title 38 U.S.C.
- **Section 1007:** Restoration of entitlement for VR&E participants when an educational institution closes or disapproves -- parity with Post-9/11 GI Bill protections. If your school shuts down mid-semester, you get that entitlement time back.
- **Section 1025 (CRITICAL):** Eliminated the 12-year time limitation on VR&E participation for veterans discharged on or after January 1, 2013. Previously, a veteran had to apply within 12 years of separation from service. For post-2013 veterans, there is now NO time limit on when you can apply for VR&E.
- Chapter 31 VR&E will cover tuition and fees directly (codifying existing practice)
- The name change was not just cosmetic -- it was intended to reduce stigma and broaden the program's perceived scope beyond traditional "vocational rehabilitation"

## 2.2 VERY Act of 2025 (H.R. 2625)

**Veterans Employment Readiness Yesterday Act**

- Passed the House by voice vote in July 2025
- Pending in the Senate as of February 2026
- Replaces the term "employment handicap" with "employment barrier" throughout Title 38
- Replaces "serious employment handicap" with "serious employment barrier"
- Definitions and eligibility criteria remain substantively the same -- this is language modernization
- Rationale: Veterans and advocacy groups expressed that "handicap" is outdated, stigmatizing, and may discourage veterans from applying for the program
- If enacted, this would affect how VRCs document their eligibility determinations and how the M28C manual is written

## 2.3 Veterans Readiness and Employment Program Integrity Act (H.R. 3579)

- Passed the House September 15, 2025
- Pending in the Senate as of February 2026
- CBO estimated implementation cost under $500,000 over 2025-2030

**Key Provisions if Enacted:**

| Provision | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Complete application package required | Veterans must submit work records, educational transcripts, and other documents before VA evaluates eligibility. Designed to reduce incomplete applications clogging the system. |
| 365-day employment assistance limit | Limits the duration of employment assistance to 365 days, with a possible 180-day extension if the counselor certifies the veteran is actively searching for work. Currently there is no such limit. |
| Congressional reporting requirements | VA must report to Congress on veteran participation, wait times to meet counselors, and wages before and after program completion. Currently this data is not systematically collected or reported. |
| External program review | VA must contract with an outside entity for a one-time comprehensive review of the entire VR&E program. |

**Veteran Advocacy Group Concerns:**
- Veterans Education Success and VFW have expressed concerns that the 365-day employment assistance limit could harm veterans with severe disabilities who need longer support
- The complete application package requirement could create additional barriers to access for veterans who struggle with paperwork due to their disabilities

## 2.4 Subsistence Allowance Rate Changes

VR&E subsistence allowance rates are adjusted annually, typically tied to cost-of-living increases:

| Fiscal Year | Maximum Rate (Full-Time, No Dependents) | COLA Increase |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|---------------|
| FY 2023 | ~$3,152/month | ~8.7% |
| FY 2024 | ~$3,254/month | ~3.2% |
| FY 2025 (Oct 2024 - Sep 2025) | $3,355.39/month | 3.2% |
| FY 2026 (Oct 2025 - Sep 2026) | $3,439.23/month | 2.5% |

**Rate Variations:**
- Rates depend on training type: full-time, three-quarter time, half-time
- Additional amounts for each dependent (spouse, children)
- If the veteran qualifies for Post-9/11 GI Bill, they may receive the Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) rate instead of the standard subsistence allowance -- BAH is often higher, especially in high-cost areas
- BAH payments cease during semester breaks, creating financial strain for veterans in education tracks

**Official Rate Tables:**
- FY 2026: https://www.benefits.va.gov/vocrehab/vrerates26.asp
- FY 2025: https://www.benefits.va.gov/vocrehab/vrerates25.asp
- FY 2024: https://www.benefits.va.gov/vocrehab/vrerates24.asp
- FY 2023: https://www.benefits.va.gov/VOCREHAB/VREratesFY23.asp

## 2.5 The 48-Month Entitlement

- The 48-month limit remains in place as of February 2026. This is the standard maximum duration for a VR&E program.
- Extensions beyond 48 months are possible but require approval from BOTH a counseling psychologist AND a VR&E officer
- **CRITICAL SEQUENCING RULE:** If you used other VA education benefits (GI Bill) FIRST, that time counts AGAINST your 48-month VR&E entitlement. But if you use VR&E FIRST, it does NOT count against your GI Bill entitlement. Strategy: Always use VR&E before GI Bill to maximize total available benefit months.
- Combined VA education/training benefits cannot exceed 48 months total across all programs (38 U.S.C. 3695), with certain exceptions
- Some sources indicate veterans can now pursue training programs lasting up to six years under certain circumstances, likely referring to approved extensions for complex rehabilitation plans

## 2.6 Independent Living Program Changes

- Limited to 24 months of services, with possible extension if it would substantially increase independence in daily living
- Statutory annual cap of approximately 2,700 participants nationwide
- No major legislative changes to the independent living track in 2023-2026
- This is the most restrictive track and is used for veterans whose disabilities are so severe that employment is not currently feasible

## 2.7 Pending/Proposed Legislation to Watch

- **S. 1234 (various):** Multiple Senate bills referencing VR&E have been introduced but not advanced
- **VA FY2026 Budget Request:** Includes requests for additional VR&E counselor positions, but implementation depends on hiring freeze status
- **Government Accountability and Transparency efforts:** Multiple oversight requests pending regarding VR&E documentation and outcomes

# 3. PACT ACT IMPACTS ON VR&E

## 3.1 Indirect but Massive Impact

The PACT Act (Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022, Public Law 117-168) did NOT directly change VR&E eligibility rules, program structure, or benefits. However, its impact on VR&E has been enormous through indirect pathways:

## 3.2 Expanded Eligibility Pool

**How it works:**
- VR&E requires a minimum 10% service-connected disability rating with an employment barrier
- The PACT Act created new presumptive service connections for toxic exposure conditions (burn pits, Agent Orange expansion, radiation, etc.)
- Every veteran who received a new or increased rating through PACT Act presumptives became potentially eligible for VR&E
- Hundreds of thousands of new ratings were processed in 2022-2025

**The result:**
- A massive surge in VR&E applications
- The already-strained system was flooded with new applicants
- Wait times increased dramatically
- This is one of the primary drivers of the current 62,000+ application backlog

## 3.3 Specific PACT Act Provisions Relevant to VR&E

- **Burn pit exposure presumptives:** Veterans who served in Southwest Asia, Somalia, and other locations now have presumptive service connection for over 20 conditions including various cancers, respiratory diseases, and other conditions
- **Agent Orange expansion:** New locations added, date ranges expanded
- **Radiation exposure expansion:** Additional conditions and locations covered
- Each of these new ratings could trigger VR&E eligibility if the veteran has at least a 10% combined rating

## 3.4 The Cascading Effect

The PACT Act's impact on VR&E illustrates a systemic problem:
1. Congress expanded disability ratings (PACT Act) without proportionally expanding VR&E staffing
2. New ratings created new VR&E eligibility
3. VR&E could not hire fast enough to keep up
4. The 2025 hiring freeze made it impossible to catch up
5. The October 2025 government shutdown added thousands more to the backlog
6. As of February 2026, the system is critically backlogged

# 4. PROGRAM STATISTICS AND REALITIES

## 4.1 Participation Numbers

| Metric | Number | Source |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Veterans receiving VR&E services (FY 2024) | ~267,613 | VA OIG testimony to Congress |
| Veterans receiving VR&E benefits annually (May 2024 estimate) | ~125,000 | VFW congressional testimony |
| Pending applications (backlog) | 61,988+ | Disabled Veterans reporting |
| Total pending caseload | 186,000+ | VA disclosure |

## 4.2 Track Usage

| Track | Percentage |
|-------|------------|
| Employment Through Long-Term Services (education/training) | 88% |
| All other tracks combined | 12% |
| - Rapid Access to Employment | subset of 12% |
| - Self-Employment | subset of 12% |
| - Reemployment | subset of 12% |
| - Independent Living | subset of 12% (capped at ~2,700/year) |

## 4.3 Success Rates (from July 2024 VR&E Longitudinal Study)

The VR&E Longitudinal Study is mandated by Congress and provides the most comprehensive outcome data:

| Metric | Rate | Detail |
|--------|------|--------|
| Employment rate (rehabilitated participants) | 73% | Among those who completed the program |
| Job match rate | 78% | Achieved jobs matching or somewhat matching their training plan |
| Median annual income | $81,000 | For rehabilitated participants |
| Satisfaction rate | 96% | Among program completers |
| Full goal achievement (20-year study) | ~33% | One-third fully achieved program goals over 20-year study period |
| Employment within 6 months of completion | >50% | More than half found employment within 6 months |

## 4.4 Discontinuation Problem

| Metric | Rate |
|--------|------|
| Discontinuation rate | >50% (more than half of all participants discontinue) |
| Discontinued but employed in matching job | 48% |
| Discontinued but later reentered the program | 60% |

The high discontinuation rate is a major program concern. Reasons include:
- Counselor unresponsiveness
- Long wait times between service authorizations
- Program bureaucracy and paperwork burden
- Life circumstances (health, family, financial)
- Frustration with the process
- Counselor turnover -- veterans get reassigned mid-program

## 4.5 Staffing Crisis

| Metric | Current | Goal |
|--------|---------|------|
| Counselor-to-veteran ratio (national) | ~1:200 | 1:125 |
| Some offices | 1:200+ | 1:125 |
| Initial counselor meeting duration | ~15 minutes | N/A |
| Campus counselors in-person availability | Some only 2 days/week | Full-time |

## 4.6 Known Problems

Based on VFW testimony, Veterans Education Success statements, and veteran advocacy group reporting:

1. **Information Gap:** Veterans learn about VR&E primarily through word-of-mouth. TAP (Transition Assistance Program) briefings provide minimal coverage of VR&E. Multiple sources describe VR&E as feeling like "a big secret."

2. **Counselor Quality Issues:** VFW testimony states that following previous statements to Congress in 2019, 2022, and 2024, complaints indicate the VR&E process is "often too complicated and stressful, with counselors who prove to be unresponsive, or even antagonistic, to a veteran's interests."

3. **Counselor Turnover:** High turnover due to low job satisfaction and heavy caseloads. Veterans frequently get reassigned to new counselors mid-program, requiring them to re-explain their situation.

4. **System Inconsistency:** VR&E implementation varies significantly by regional office. What gets approved in one office may be denied in another.

5. **Self-Employment Track Barriers:** The self-employment track is widely reported as the hardest to get approved, taking the longest, and having the most bureaucratic hurdles.

6. **Housing Allowance Gaps:** Chapter 31 subsistence allowance is considered inadequate in many markets. Veterans who transferred GI Bill benefits lose BAH eligibility. BAH payments cease during semester breaks.

7. **The "Counselor Roulette" Problem:** Veterans have historically been assigned to whichever counselor was available rather than one matched to their needs. VA announced changes to address this in 2025.

# 5. GAO AND OIG REPORTS

## 5.1 VA OIG Report 23-03328-197 (September 30, 2025)

**Title:** "The Accuracy of Veteran Readiness and Employment Claims Cannot Be Assessed Because of Insufficient Documentation"

**Key Findings:**
- The VA OIG could not even assess whether VR&E claims were being processed accurately because the documentation was so poor
- VR&E case files lacked the required documentation to support eligibility and entitlement decisions
- The subjective aspects of VR&E laws, regulations, and manual create inherent risks of fraud, waste, and abuse
- These risks require strong internal controls with clear policies, procedures, oversight, and monitoring -- which were not in place
- Given the billions of dollars at issue, the documentation failures represent a significant vulnerability

**Substantiated Allegations:**
- OIG substantiated an allegation that VR&E staff improperly authorized participants to attend certain programs during FY 2024

**Why This Matters for Veterans:**
- If the VA cannot document that its own decisions are accurate, individual veterans cannot have confidence that their eligibility determinations, service authorizations, and denials are being made correctly
- This report provides ammunition for appeals -- if VA denies a claim, the veteran can cite this OIG finding that VA's own documentation is inadequate

## 5.2 GAO-25-106876 (September 2025)

**Title:** "Veterans Employment: VA Should Address Human Capital Needs and Other Issues in High-Tech Training"

**Key Findings:**
- Examined VA high-tech training programs for veterans
- Found human capital needs and administrative issues
- Recommended VA address staffing and program management deficiencies

## 5.3 VR&E Longitudinal Study (Ongoing, Mandated by Congress)

- Annual reports submitted to the Senate and House Committees on Veterans Affairs
- Tracks long-term post-program outcomes for veterans who establish and participate in rehabilitation plans
- The July 2024 report provided the 73% employment rate and $81,000 median income figures cited above
- Available at: https://www.benefits.va.gov/VOCREHAB/VRELongitudinalStudy.asp

## 5.4 Congressional Oversight (2024-2025)

**House Subcommittee Hearings:**
- December 2024: "Examining the Effectiveness of the Veterans Readiness and Employment (VR&E) Program" -- included VFW testimony
- "Path of Purpose: Restoring the VA VR&E Program to Effectively Serve Veterans" -- included Veterans Education Success statement for the record
- July 2025: House subcommittee pressed VA on Chapter 35 payment delays, long VR&E wait times, and VET TEC rollout

**Key Testimony Themes:**
- Counselor caseloads are unsustainable
- Wait times for initial appointments are too long
- Program outcomes data is inadequate
- Self-employment track is underutilized and over-bureaucratized
- Regional variation in program implementation is unacceptable

## 5.5 VA OIG Investigation -- VR&E Staff Conduct

- The OIG conducted investigations into VR&E staff conduct during FY 2024-2025
- Findings substantiated improper authorization of program participation
- Details in House testimony documents (HHRG-119-VR10-20250716-SD002.pdf)

# 6. SELF-EMPLOYMENT TRACK SPECIFICS

## 6.1 Overview

The Self-Employment Track is one of five VR&E service tracks. It is designed for veterans whose service-connected disabilities make traditional employment difficult but who have the drive, skills, and aptitude to start and run their own business. It is widely reported as the most difficult track to get approved, the most bureaucratic, and the longest timeline from application to approval.

## 6.2 The Three Self-Employment Categories

**Category I (Most Severe -- Highest Funding):**
- Veteran has a "serious employment handicap" (will become "serious employment barrier" if VERY Act passes)
- The most severe service-connected disabilities
- Employability limitations are so severe that self-employment is the ONLY viable option
- All other reasonable employment goals have been determined unsuitable due to disability severity
- Requires BOTH VR&E Regional Office (VREO) AND Central Office (CO) approval before plan development can begin
- Can receive the most comprehensive funding package
- No specific dollar cap published in publicly available materials, but must be a "realistic start-up budget" with only essential items
- Community reports suggest 7-9 months for Category I funding approval
- This is the category that provides the most resources but has the highest approval threshold

**Category II (Moderate):**
- Veteran has an employment barrier but self-employment is not the only option
- The veteran and VRC have determined that self-employment is the best option among multiple viable alternatives
- May receive comprehensive training in the vocational goal AND incidental training in small business management
- Does NOT need Central Office approval -- VRC/VREO approval is sufficient to begin plan development
- Lower funding threshold than Category I
- More commonly approved than Category I

**Category III (Least Severe -- Most Limited Support):**
- Veterans with the least severe employment barriers
- Self-employment is one of several viable options
- Receive the most limited self-employment support
- Generally limited to guidance, counseling, and minimal supplies/equipment
- Fastest approval timeline

## 6.3 Business Plan Requirements

The business plan is the centerpiece of any self-employment application:

1. **Development:** The veteran works with the VRC to develop a comprehensive business plan
2. **Viability Analysis:** The VRC completes a summation of the business plan viability analysis that must answer key questions with supporting documentation
3. **Clear Viability Statement:** The summation must clearly identify whether the business plan is viable and what rehabilitation services are needed
4. **Financial Projections:** The plan must include realistic revenue projections, startup costs, ongoing expenses, and break-even timeline
5. **Market Analysis:** Must demonstrate demand for the product or service
6. **Skills Assessment:** Must show the veteran has the skills, aptitude, and drive to succeed
7. **Disability Accommodation:** Must address how the veteran's disabilities will be accommodated in the business context
8. **Alternate Funding:** When costs exceed what VA can authorize, the veteran must identify alternate funding sources in the business plan

**After Approval:**
- If the VR&E Regional Office approves the self-employment plan, the Veteran and VRC both sign VAF 28-8872 (Rehabilitation Plan)
- The plan then authorizes specific services, training, equipment, and supplies

## 6.4 Feasibility Study Requirements

- A feasibility assessment is conducted as part of the business plan review process
- The VRC evaluates whether the proposed business concept is viable in the veteran's local market
- May involve consultation with SBA (Small Business Administration) or local small business development centers
- The feasibility study considers: market demand, competition, veteran's skills and experience, startup costs, local economic conditions, and disability impact

## 6.5 Equipment and Supplies

**What VR&E Can Provide:**
- Essential equipment needed to establish the business
- The M28R manual uses the example of a tractor for a farming business
- Computer equipment, specialized tools, professional equipment
- Business supplies
- Licensing fees and costs
- Training materials

**Limitations:**
- When the veteran's business requires supplies or fees greater in amount than VA may authorize, the veteran is responsible for securing alternate funding sources
- The source of payment or resources available for such items must be identified in the business plan
- Equipment purchased by VA may remain VA property and could need to be returned if the business fails
- Dollar thresholds exist above which higher-level approval is required (specific amounts not publicly published but community reports suggest ~$25,000 is a common practical threshold before Central Office involvement)

## 6.6 Can VR&E Fund a PI License or Investigative Business?

**Short Answer: Yes, in principle.** VR&E can fund self-employment in any legitimate business that aligns with the veteran's abilities, interests, and disabilities.

**What Could Be Covered for a PI Business:**

| Item | Coverable? | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| PI licensing training/courses | YES | Would be classified as vocational training needed for the business |
| State licensing fees | YES | Part of business startup costs |
| Licensing exam fees | YES | Part of qualification requirements |
| Surety bond (if required by state) | MAYBE | Would need to be justified in business plan |
| Equipment (cameras, computers, surveillance gear) | YES | Essential business equipment |
| Vehicle modifications | YES | If disability-related |
| Business startup costs | YES | Within authorization limits |
| Small business management training | YES | Standard part of self-employment track |
| Office space/rent | MAYBE | Less commonly funded; would need strong justification |
| Insurance (professional liability) | MAYBE | Would need to be in business plan |

**Key Requirements for Approval:**
1. The VRC must determine that self-employment as a PI is a viable vocational goal given the veteran's specific service-connected disabilities
2. It must represent a reasonable path to rehabilitation
3. The business plan must be viable
4. The veteran must demonstrate the skills, drive, and aptitude for the PI business
5. The veteran's disabilities must create an employment barrier that self-employment addresses better than traditional employment

**Oregon PI License Requirements (for reference):**
- Oregon requires completion of specific training hours
- Background check
- State licensing through DPSST (Department of Public Safety Standards and Training)
- These training and licensing costs would be eligible for VR&E funding if the self-employment plan is approved

## 6.7 Self-Employment Track Success Rate and Duration

- Specific success rate data for the self-employment track is NOT publicly reported separately from overall VR&E statistics
- Only about 12% of all VR&E participants use tracks other than Long-Term Services, and self-employment is a subset of that 12% -- making it a small fraction of total participants
- The track is described as the most difficult to get approved and the longest timeline
- Community reports suggest 7-9 months for Category I funding approval
- A veteran is considered "rehabilitated" on the self-employment track when they have maintained a viable business for one year after completing the plan
- The overall VR&E rehabilitation rate of 73% likely does not reflect self-employment track performance specifically

---

# 7. INTERACTION WITH OTHER BENEFITS

## 7.1 VR&E + GI Bill Coordination (CRITICAL -- ORDER MATTERS)

This is one of the most important benefit interactions to understand:

**The Sequencing Rule:**
- If you use VR&E FIRST: VR&E time does NOT deduct from your GI Bill entitlement. You keep the full GI Bill.
- If you use GI Bill FIRST: The time used COUNTS AGAINST your 48-month VR&E entitlement.
- STRATEGY: Always use VR&E before GI Bill to maximize total available benefit months.

**Combined Limit:**
- 38 U.S.C. 3695 limits combined VA education/training benefits to 48 months total across all programs
- However, the sequencing rule above means the order of use matters significantly

**BAH vs. Subsistence Allowance:**
- While on VR&E using an education program, if you qualify for Post-9/11 GI Bill, you may be eligible to receive the Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) rate instead of the standard VR&E subsistence allowance
- BAH rates are based on the school's ZIP code and are often significantly higher than the subsistence allowance
- BAH payments cease during semester breaks -- plan for this gap

**Entitlement Restoration:**
- The Isakson-Roe Act (2020) added entitlement restoration for VR&E participants when an educational institution closes (parity with GI Bill protections)

## 7.2 VR&E + VA Disability Compensation

**No Reduction:**
- VR&E does NOT reduce your VA disability compensation. You continue to receive your full monthly VA disability pay while participating in VR&E.
- VR&E subsistence allowance is paid IN ADDITION TO your disability compensation.
- These are two separate benefits from two separate parts of Title 38.

**No Rating Impact:**
- VR&E participation does NOT trigger a re-evaluation of your disability rating.
- A standard schedular rating (10%, 30%, 50%, etc.) is not affected by VR&E enrollment, participation, or completion.
- The only exception is the TDIU situation described below.

## 7.3 VR&E + TDIU (Total Disability Individual Unemployability) -- MAJOR CAUTION

This is the most dangerous benefit interaction and requires careful consideration:

**Can You Use Both?**
- There is NO regulation anywhere that prohibits a veteran with 100% TDIU from using VR&E
- Veterans with TDIU can and do use VR&E for retraining
- The programs are legally independent

**The Conflict:**
- TDIU is awarded to veterans whose service-connected disabilities prevent them from gaining or retaining "substantially gainful employment"
- VR&E participation signals intent to rejoin the workforce
- A VR&E finding of "employability" could directly contradict the basis for TDIU

**The Risk:**
- If a veteran completes a VR&E rehabilitation plan, VR&E personnel are REQUIRED to notify the Compensation & Pension (C&P) division
- After notification, a re-evaluation of the veteran's TDIU rating is "highly likely"
- If C&P determines the veteran is now employable, TDIU could be reduced or terminated
- This could result in a significant monthly income reduction

**Bottom Line:**
- If you have TDIU, consult a veterans law attorney BEFORE enrolling in VR&E
- Understand that successful completion of VR&E could trigger TDIU review
- Some veterans on TDIU use VR&E for training but do not complete the program to avoid triggering the notification
- This is a strategic decision with significant financial implications

## 7.4 VR&E + Social Security Disability (SSDI)

**Independence of Benefits:**
- VA disability compensation and SSDI are completely independent -- one does not affect the other
- SSDI only counts EARNED income; VA disability payments are not earned income and have no effect on SSDI eligibility or payment amount

**Working While on SSDI:**
- If VR&E helps you get a job and your EARNINGS exceed the Substantial Gainful Activity (SGA) threshold, SSA will review your SSDI eligibility
- The 2024 SGA threshold was $1,550/month for non-blind individuals
- Social Security has a Trial Work Period (9 months in a rolling 60-month period) during which you can earn any amount without losing SSDI
- After the trial work period, if earnings exceed SGA, SSDI benefits may be suspended or terminated

**Key Difference from VA Disability:**
- Unlike VA disability, where you can work and still receive benefits (except TDIU), SSDI has strict work limitations
- VR&E subsistence allowance is NOT considered earned income for SSDI purposes

## 7.5 VR&E + State Vocational Rehabilitation

- If a veteran is not entitled to VR&E, the VRC may refer them to state vocational rehabilitation services
- State and federal VR programs can potentially coordinate, but VA VR&E is generally the superior benefit
- Oregon's state VR program is run by the Oregon Department of Human Services, Vocational Rehabilitation Division
- Some veterans use both programs simultaneously for different services, but this is unusual and requires coordination between the two agencies
- State VR programs have their own eligibility criteria and are not limited to service-connected disabilities

## 7.6 VR&E + Unemployment Benefits

- There is no specific prohibition on collecting state unemployment benefits while applying for or initially enrolled in VR&E
- Once actively in full-time training, the subsistence allowance is the primary VA income support
- State unemployment requirements typically include job search activity and availability for work, which may conflict with full-time training
- If a veteran is in the Rapid Access to Employment track (job placement), unemployment benefits and VR&E could potentially overlap
- Check Oregon-specific unemployment rules for interaction with VA training benefits

## 7.7 Can You Work While on VR&E?

**YES.** There is no prohibition on working while enrolled in VR&E.

**Considerations:**
- If you are working full-time in a job that pays well, the VRC may question whether you truly have an "employment barrier" that VR&E needs to address
- Part-time work is generally not a problem and can support your rehabilitation
- If you are on the self-employment track, your business activities ARE your rehabilitation
- Income from work does not reduce your subsistence allowance
- Income from work does not affect your disability compensation (except TDIU)
- If you have SSDI, earned income above SGA threshold could affect those benefits (see 7.4)

## 7.8 Does VR&E Affect Your Disability Rating?

**NO.** Participation in VR&E does not affect your disability rating.

**The Only Exception:**
- The TDIU situation described in 7.3, where successful rehabilitation could trigger a C&P review of the TDIU rating
- A standard schedular rating is never affected by VR&E

# 8. COVID-ERA CHANGES THAT BECAME PERMANENT

## 8.1 Virtual and Remote Services

**What Changed During COVID:**
- VR&E transitioned to virtual appointments when in-person services were suspended
- Video conferences, phone consultations, and electronic document exchange became standard
- Online orientation sessions replaced in-person group orientations

**What Became Permanent:**
- In-person AND virtual meetings are now available at all regional offices
- Veterans can meet with VRCs remotely via video or phone for most interactions
- The VA confirmed that virtual VR&E services will continue indefinitely
- This is particularly valuable for veterans in rural areas (like Eastern Oregon) who previously had to travel significant distances to Portland, Eugene, or Roseburg for appointments
- Veterans can request virtual meetings by contacting their assigned VRC or through the VERA (Veterans Appointment Request) scheduling system

## 8.2 Electronic Document Processing

- VR&E accelerated its transition to electronic case management during COVID
- More documents can now be submitted electronically
- VA Form 28-1900 (Application for VR&E) can be submitted online at va.gov

## 8.3 Flexible Training Accommodations

- VR&E became more accommodating of online education and distance learning during COVID
- This flexibility has largely remained in place
- Veterans in education tracks have more options for online vs. in-person coursework

## 8.4 The RES System Rollout

- The Readiness and Employment System (RES) was developed and launched nationwide by mid-2025
- Modernizes the VR&E case management system
- Replaces older legacy IT infrastructure
- Intended to improve counselor efficiency and reduce processing times
- Implementation has been uneven, with some offices adapting faster than others

---

# 9. VA INTERNAL POLICIES AND GUIDANCE

## 9.1 VBA Letters and Policy Directives

The VA does not publicly post most internal training letters and fast letters for VR&E. These are internal VA documents distributed to Vocational Rehabilitation Counselors through internal channels. However:
- The M28C itself now contains template decision letters and guidance that were previously internal-only
- The WARMS page still hosts some legacy policy circulars
- VR&E Materials and Factsheets are available at: https://www.benefits.va.gov/vocrehab/links_resources.asp

## 9.2 VRC Qualification Standards

Vocational Rehabilitation Counselors (VRCs) must meet specific federal qualification standards:
- Must hold a master's degree (or higher) in rehabilitation counseling, rehabilitation services, clinical rehabilitation counseling, counseling psychology, mental health counseling, career counseling, or social work from an accredited institution
- GS-0101 occupational series
- These qualification standards are publicly available on the VA Human Resources website

## 9.3 Regional Office Variation

VR&E implementation varies significantly by regional office:
- What gets approved at one office may be denied at another
- Counselor caseloads differ dramatically by location
- Wait times for initial appointments vary from weeks to months
- Self-employment track approval rates differ by region
- Some offices have specialized self-employment counselors; others do not
- Campus-based VSOC (Veteran Success on Campus) counselors exist at some colleges but not others
- VSOC counselors are sometimes assigned VR&E casework beyond their intended campus duties, further straining the system

## 9.4 Appeals and Grievances

If a VR&E claim is denied or a veteran disagrees with a counselor's decision:
- The veteran can request an Administrative Review by the VR&E Officer at the regional office
- Beyond that, the veteran can file a formal appeal through the Board of Veterans Appeals (BVA)
- The veteran can also file a complaint with the VA Inspector General
- Congressional representatives can make inquiries on behalf of constituent veterans
- Veterans Service Organizations (VSOs) can assist with appeals

---

# 10. CURRENT POLITICAL AND OPERATIONAL CONTEXT (FEBRUARY 2026)

## 10.1 Government Shutdown Impact (October 2025)

- ALL VR&E counselors were furloughed nationwide during the government shutdown
- VR&E was NOT classified as "essential" during the shutdown -- meaning ALL services stopped completely
- Over 100,000 enrolled veterans lost access to counseling and case management
- Subsistence allowance payments froze for thousands of veterans
- The backlog grew by an estimated 10,000+ additional cases during the shutdown
- After the shutdown ended, advocacy groups demanded VA leadership reclassify VR&E as "essential" to prevent future service disruptions

## 10.2 Hiring Freeze

- A federal hiring freeze is in effect as of February 2026
- The VA is not replacing VR&E counselors who leave or retire
- This is driving caseloads from 1:175 toward 1:200+ in many offices
- At least one VR&E counselor publicly resigned citing the hiring freeze and unsustainable caseload
- The union contract for VR&E counselors was cancelled
- Veteran advocacy groups are warning of accelerating service degradation

## 10.3 The "Counselor Roulette" Fix

- VA announced changes in 2025 to end "counselor roulette" -- the practice of assigning veterans to whichever counselor happened to be available rather than matching them to a counselor suited to their needs
- Implementation status is unclear given the staffing crisis

## 10.4 What This Means for Veterans Walking In Today

1. Expect longer wait times than normal
2. Your counselor is likely overloaded with 200+ cases
3. Come extremely prepared -- you may only get 15 minutes
4. Document everything in writing
5. If denied, appeal -- the OIG just found VA's documentation is inadequate
6. Virtual appointments are available and may be faster to schedule than in-person
7. Be specific about your vocational goal from the very first meeting
8. Ask for your counselor's direct contact information
9. Consider involving a VSO if you encounter resistance

# 11. PREPARING FOR A VR&E APPOINTMENT

## 11.1 What to Bring

- DD-214 (if not already on file with VA)
- VA disability rating letter or eBenefits/va.gov printout showing current rating percentage
- All educational transcripts (civilian AND military training records)
- Work history / resume
- Medical records documenting how service-connected disabilities specifically affect employability
- A written statement of career goals -- be SPECIFIC (not "I want to go to school" but "I want to obtain my Oregon PI license and start a private investigation business because [reasons]")
- If pursuing self-employment: any research on licensing requirements, training programs, startup costs
- A rough business plan outline if pursuing self-employment
- List of questions to ask the VRC
- Notebook and pen for taking notes

## 11.2 Critical Tips

**Preparation is Everything:**
- The outcome of most VR&E claims hinges on the first appointment with the Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor
- A well-prepared approach sets the stage for approval; common mistakes lead to denials that are hard to overturn

**Be Specific About Your Goal:**
- Do NOT walk in saying "I want to go to school" or "I need help finding work" -- that is too vague
- Be precise and realistic: "I want to use VR&E's self-employment track to fund my Oregon PI license training, obtain necessary equipment, and establish a private investigation business"
- Your vocational goal should align with both your interests and your physical/mental capabilities given your service-connected disabilities

**Connect Disability to Employment Barrier:**
- The VRC needs to document that your service-connected disability creates a barrier to employment
- Explain specifically how your disability makes traditional employment difficult
- Explain how the proposed vocational goal (PI business) accommodates your disabilities
- Do NOT downplay your disabilities -- the VRC assesses eligibility partly based on severity

**Ask Questions:**
- Ask about the self-employment track specifically
- Ask what documentation they need from you
- Ask about timeline expectations
- Ask about subsistence allowance eligibility
- Ask about the business plan development process

**Get Contact Information:**
- Get your VRC's direct phone number and email address
- Given the staffing crisis, having a direct line is invaluable
- Ask about preferred communication method

**Document Everything:**
- Take detailed notes during the meeting
- Follow up in writing (email or letter) summarizing what was discussed
- Keep copies of everything you submit
- Save all communications

**Expect a Short Meeting:**
- VFW testimony found initial counselor meetings average approximately 15 minutes
- Be prepared to be efficient and focused
- Have your key points written down so you do not forget anything

**If Denied, Appeal:**
- Denials can be overturned
- Request a copy of the denial letter and the specific reasons for denial
- File an administrative review with the VR&E Officer
- Contact a VSO for assistance with the appeal
- Cite the M28C manual provisions that support your claim

# RESEARCH NOTES

**Date of Research:** February 23, 2026
**Researcher:** Claude (Opus 4.6) at request of Levi Bakke
**Methodology:** Web search across va.gov, congress.gov, gao.gov, va.gov/oig, federalregister.gov, veteran advocacy sites, and veteran community forums. PDF and web page content extraction where accessible.

**Limitations:**
- The M28C manual on KnowVA requires JavaScript to load and could not be fully extracted via automated tools
- The VA Annual Benefits Report PDF (FY2024) was not machine-readable through web fetch
- Specific self-employment funding dollar caps are not published in publicly available materials
- Internal VA training letters and fast letters are not publicly accessible
- Self-employment track success rates are not reported separately from overall VR&E statistics

**Key Takeaway:** VR&E is one of the most valuable VA benefits available, with 73% employment rate for completers and $81,000 median income. The self-employment track can fund a PI business including licensing, training, and equipment. But the system is under extreme strain -- 62,000+ backlog, 1:200 counselor ratios, hiring freeze, and a government shutdown that froze all services in late 2025. Come to the appointment overprepared.
