## 1. OVERVIEW — THE COUNSELOR'S ROLE

The person sitting across from you is either a **Counseling Psychologist (CP)** or a **Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC)**. Both are trained at the **master's degree level** in counseling or rehabilitation. They are mandated to follow the **M28C manual** (formerly M28R) — this is their bible.

Their job during intake is to:
- Determine if you have an **employment handicap** (EH)
- Determine if you have a **serious employment handicap** (SEH)
- Determine if achieving a **vocational goal is reasonably feasible**
- Identify the appropriate **program track** for you
- Begin developing your **Individualized Written Rehabilitation Plan** (IWRP)

**Authority:** 38 CFR 21.50, 38 U.S.C. Chapter 31

**Caseload standard:** VA policy targets **1 counselor per 125 veterans** (1:125 ratio). In practice, as of July 2025 congressional testimony, the actual ratio is **1:175** — 40% above the standard. Some offices report ratios exceeding **1:230**.

---

## 2. BEFORE THE APPOINTMENT — PRE-MEETING PREPARATION

### What the Counselor Is Supposed to Do Before You Walk In

Per M28R Part IV and 38 CFR 21.50(c), the VRC should:

1. **Review your VA claims file (C-file)** — medical records, service-connected disability ratings, service history
2. **Review your application** (VA Form 28-1900) that you submitted
3. **Note your disability rating percentage** and which conditions are service-connected
4. **Review any prior Chapter 31 participation** — if you've been in VR&E before, the VRC must review the reasons for prior case closure during the comprehensive evaluation
5. **Prepare the assessment materials** — have the Rehabilitation Needs Inventory (RNI) and other forms ready
6. **Note any PTSD, TBI, or mental health conditions** — these require enhanced individualized support

### Reality Check
Congressional testimony and VA OIG reports indicate many counselors do NOT thoroughly review the file before the appointment. The OIG report VAOIG-23-03328-197 (Sept 2025) found that **"The Accuracy of Veteran Readiness and Employment Claims Cannot Be Assessed Because of Insufficient Documentation"** — meaning counselors aren't even documenting their work properly, let alone preparing adequately.

---

## 3. THE ORIENTATION (GROUP SESSION)

Before your one-on-one initial evaluation, most VA offices conduct a **group orientation session**. This typically happens:
- **Same day** as the initial evaluation (morning orientation, afternoon 1-on-1), OR
- **Separate day** with the evaluation scheduled later

### What Should Happen at Orientation

1. **Overview of VR&E program** — what Chapter 31 benefits are
2. **Explanation of the 5 program tracks** (Reemployment, Rapid Access, Self-Employment, Long-Term Services, Independent Living)
3. **Explanation of the evaluation process** — what will happen next
4. **Distribution of initial paperwork:**
   - **VA Form 28-1902w** — Rehabilitation Needs Inventory (RNI)
   - **CareerScope assessment** login credentials (online aptitude/interest test)
   - Employment Planning Questionnaire
5. **Overview of veteran rights and responsibilities**
6. **Assignment to a specific VRC** — you'll be told who your counselor is

### What You Fill Out During/After Orientation

The RNI (28-1902w) is approximately **6 pages** of questions covering:
- Educational background
- Employment history
- Skills and interests
- Type of work you'd like training for
- Barriers to employment
- Daily living challenges
- Medical/mental health status

The **CareerScope assessment** is an online test measuring:
- Aptitudes (mechanical reasoning, numerical ability, etc.)
- Career interests
- Skill levels

Other assessment tools the VRC may assign:
- **COPES** (Career Orientation Placement and Evaluation Survey)
- **O*NET Interests Profiler**

---

## 4. THE INITIAL EVALUATION APPOINTMENT — STEP BY STEP

This is the **one-on-one meeting** with your assigned VRC. Per 38 CFR 21.50, this is what's supposed to happen:

### Step 1: Review of RNI and Assessment Results
The VRC reviews your completed Rehabilitation Needs Inventory (28-1902w) and uses it to "obtain additional and missing information necessary to determine entitlement to Chapter 31 benefits, using their counseling skills to assist with making an entitlement determination."

### Step 2: Comprehensive Evaluation
Per 38 CFR 21.50(c) and M28C.IV.B.1, the VRC must develop and assess **all of the following:**

**(a) Disability Impact Assessment**
- Handicapping effects of service-connected AND non-service-connected disabilities on employability and independence in daily living

**(b) Physical and Mental Capabilities**
- Assessment of physical and mental capabilities that affect employability and daily functioning

**(c) Vocational Impairment Assessment**
- Impact of vocational impairments on ability to prepare for, obtain, and maintain employment

**(d) Abilities, Aptitudes, and Interests**
- Review of CareerScope/COPES results
- Discussion of career aspirations
- Assessment of transferable skills

**(e) Personal History and Circumstances**
- Education and training history
- Employment record
- Family adjustment
- Community adjustment
- Other relevant personal circumstances

**(f) Other Employability Factors**
- Labor market conditions
- Discrimination barriers
- Geographic limitations
- Transportation issues
- Childcare needs
- Housing stability

### Step 3: Interview and Discussion
The VRC should:
- **Listen to your career goals** and what you want to do
- **Ask about barriers** you face in getting/keeping employment
- **Discuss your disabilities** — how they impact your daily life AND work capability
- **Ask about your support system** — family, housing, financial stability
- **Explore vocational options** matching your abilities and interests
- **Discuss all 5 program tracks** and which might fit your situation

### Step 4: Entitlement Determination
Based on the comprehensive evaluation, the VRC makes three formal determinations (see Section 6 below).

### Step 5: Track Placement Discussion
If entitled, the VRC explains which track they recommend and why.

### Step 6: Begin Plan Development
If entitled, the VRC begins working with you on your Individualized Written Rehabilitation Plan (IWRP).

### How Long Should This Take?
Veterans report the initial evaluation can take **1.5 to 3.5 hours**. Congressional testimony references veterans spending "nearly 3.5 hours of discussion" at their initial meeting. If your counselor is rushing through this in 20-30 minutes, they are not conducting a proper comprehensive evaluation.

## 5. ASSESSMENT TOOLS THE COUNSELOR MUST USE

Per M28R Part IV, Section B, Chapter 3, the VRC has these tools available and should be using them:

### Required Assessments
| Tool | Purpose | Format |
|------|---------|--------|
| **VA Form 28-1902w (RNI)** | Rehabilitation Needs Inventory — veteran self-report of needs | Paper/electronic form |
| **CareerScope** | Aptitude and interest assessment (online at National Portal) | Online test |
| **VA Form 28-1902b** | Counseling Record — where VRC documents EH/SEH/feasibility determination | Counselor form |
| **VA Form 28-1902n** | Counseling Narrative — detailed rationale for decisions | Counselor form |

### Optional/Supplemental Assessments
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **COPES** | Career Orientation Placement and Evaluation Survey |
| **O*NET Interests Profiler** | Occupational interest inventory |
| **Medical/psychological evaluations** | Referral to VA medical for specific assessments |
| **Labor market research** | Local job market analysis for proposed career goals |
| **Transferable skills analysis** | Matching existing skills to potential careers |

### What the Counselor Does With Assessment Results
The VRC uses assessment results to:
1. Identify career interests and aptitudes
2. Determine what training or education is needed
3. Assess whether disabilities prevent certain career paths
4. Develop a realistic employment goal
5. Choose the appropriate program track

---

## 6. THE THREE REQUIRED DETERMINATIONS

The VRC **must** make these three determinations. They are required by law (38 U.S.C. 3102, 3106) and regulation (38 CFR 21.50-21.53).

### Determination 1: Employment Handicap (EH)
**38 CFR 21.51**

An employment handicap exists when ALL THREE conditions are met:

**(a) Vocational Impairment** — The veteran has an impairment of the ability to prepare for, obtain, or keep employment in an occupation consistent with their abilities, aptitudes, and interests.

**(b) Effects Not Overcome** — The veteran has not overcome the effects of impairment through employment in, or qualifying for employment in, a suitable occupation. This includes veterans who qualify for suitable employment but cannot obtain or retain it due to circumstances beyond their control.

**(c) Service-Connected Disability Contribution** — The service-connected disabilities must "contribute substantially" to the overall vocational impairment, having "an identifiable, measurable, or observable causative effect." They do NOT need to be the sole or primary cause.

**Rating Threshold:**
- 20%+ disability rating: Need EH to qualify
- 10% rating: Need SERIOUS Employment Handicap (SEH) to qualify

### Determination 2: Serious Employment Handicap (SEH)
**38 CFR 21.52**

A SEPARATE determination. SEH exists when the VRC finds:

**(1) Significant Vocational Impairment** — A "significant impairment of the ability to prepare for, obtain, or keep employment"

**(2) Effects Not Overcome** — Same as EH but more severe

**(3) Service-Connected Disability Contribution** — Same substantial contribution standard

**The VRC evaluates these 9 factors:**
1. Number of disabling conditions
2. Severity of condition(s)
3. Presence of neuropsychiatric conditions
4. Education/training adequacy
5. Unemployment/underemployment patterns
6. Government support program reliance
7. Complexity of service/assistance needs
8. Discrimination and labor market barriers
9. Other employment-related factors

**Why SEH Matters:**
- Veterans with SEH get MORE services and longer timeframes
- Veterans rated below 20% MUST have SEH to qualify at all
- SEH extends the basic period of eligibility beyond 12 years
- SEH allows for additional rehabilitation services

### Determination 3: Reasonable Feasibility of Vocational Goal
**38 CFR 21.53**

A "vocational goal" means "gainful employment status consistent with the veteran's abilities, aptitudes, and interests."

**Feasibility is found when:**
1. Vocational goal(s) have been identified
2. The veteran's physical and mental conditions permit training to begin within a reasonable period
3. The veteran either possesses necessary educational skills OR VA will provide services to develop them

**CRITICAL PROTECTION:** If feasibility criteria aren't fully satisfied BUT infeasibility hasn't been determined, **"VA shall provide the rehabilitation services"** as appropriate. A finding of INFEASIBILITY requires **"compelling evidence which establishes infeasibility beyond any reasonable doubt."**

This is a very high bar. The counselor cannot casually deny you — they need compelling evidence beyond reasonable doubt that you CANNOT achieve a vocational goal.

**If vocational goal is not feasible:** The VRC must then assess whether the **Independent Living** track is appropriate.

---

## 7. THE FIVE PROGRAM TRACKS — HOW THE COUNSELOR PLACES YOU

After determining entitlement, the VRC places you in one of five tracks based on your individual evaluation:

### Track 1: Reemployment
**For:** Veterans who can return to their former employer
**Counselor assesses:** Whether the veteran's former job is still available and compatible with their disabilities
**Services:** Job accommodations, employer negotiation, assistive technology, short-term training for job modification

### Track 2: Rapid Access to Employment
**For:** Veterans who already have marketable skills and just need help finding work
**Counselor assesses:** Whether existing skills are sufficient for competitive employment
**Services:** Job search assistance, resume writing, interview preparation, job placement services, on-the-job training

### Track 3: Self-Employment
**For:** Veterans whose disabilities make traditional employment difficult but who can run their own business
**Counselor assesses:** Business viability, veteran's entrepreneurial aptitude, disability accommodation needs
**Services:** Business plan development, training, startup funding, mentorship, licenses/certifications

### Track 4: Employment Through Long-Term Services
**For:** Veterans who need significant education or retraining for a new career
**Counselor assesses:** What degree/certification is needed, what school is appropriate, how long training will take
**Services:** College tuition, vocational training, books/supplies, subsistence allowance, tutoring, adjustment counseling
**This is the most commonly used track** — covers undergraduate degrees, graduate degrees, vocational certificates

### Track 5: Independent Living
**For:** Veterans whose disabilities prevent employment entirely
**Counselor assesses:** Whether the veteran can perform activities of daily living, what supports are needed
**Services:** Assistive technology, home modifications, mobility devices, community integration support
**Requires VR&E Officer concurrence** if VRC denies this track

### Track Changes
Veterans may change tracks if:
- Disability worsens
- Employment objective changes
- Assessment reveals a different track is more appropriate

---

## 8. DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS — WHAT THE COUNSELOR MUST WRITE

The VRC is required to document their evaluation thoroughly. Per M28R Part IV:

### VA Form 28-1902b (Counseling Record)
The VRC **must** document:
- The determination of Employment Handicap (EH) — Yes or No
- The determination of Serious Employment Handicap (SEH) — Yes or No
- The feasibility of achieving a vocational goal — Feasible or Not Currently Feasible
- The basis for each determination

### VA Form 28-1902n (Counseling Narrative)
The VRC **must clearly explain and document the rationale** for every decision. This is the detailed narrative explaining WHY the counselor reached their conclusions. It should include:
- Summary of the comprehensive evaluation findings
- Analysis of how disabilities impact employability
- Career interest and aptitude findings
- Rationale for track placement
- Any identified barriers and how they'll be addressed
- Vocational exploration notes
- Assessment of rehabilitation potential

### CWINRS Case Notes
The VRC must enter notes into the **Corporate WINRS** (CWINRS) case management system documenting:
- Appointment dates and duration
- Topics discussed
- Actions taken
- Follow-up needed

### VA OIG Finding (VAOIG-23-03328-197, Sept 2025)
The VA OIG found that **"The Accuracy of Veteran Readiness and Employment Claims Cannot Be Assessed Because of Insufficient Documentation."** This means counselors are systemically failing to document their determinations properly — which also means they may not be conducting thorough evaluations in the first place.

---

## 9. INFORMING THE VETERAN — WHAT THEY MUST TELL YOU

### 38 CFR 21.362 — Cooperation and Understanding
VA staff are legally required to **"make a reasonable effort to inform the veteran and assure his or her understanding"** of:
- Available services
- The veteran's specific responsibilities
- Program expectations

### 38 CFR 21.420 — Written Notification Requirements
For ANY decision affecting your benefits, the VA **must** provide written notice containing:

1. **Identification of the issues adjudicated** — what they decided
2. **Summary of evidence considered** — what they looked at
3. **Summary of applicable laws and regulations** — the legal basis
4. **Identification of findings favorable to you** — anything in your favor
5. **For denials: identification of elements not satisfied** — exactly WHY you were denied
6. **Explanation of how to access evidence used** — how to see what they based it on
7. **Summary of applicable review options** — how to appeal

### Before Any Adverse Action (Denial, Reduction, Termination)
The VA **must:**
- Grant you **at least 30 days** to review
- Allow you to **meet informally** with a VA representative
- Allow you to **review the decision basis** and relevant documents
- Allow you to **submit supporting materials**

### Favorable Findings Are Binding
Per 38 CFR 21.420: **"Any finding favorable to the veteran is binding on all subsequent agency"** adjudicators unless **"rebutted by evidence that identifies a clear and unmistakable error."**

This means if the counselor finds you HAVE an employment handicap, a later counselor cannot reverse that finding without proving clear and unmistakable error.

### VA Form 28-0957
During the rehabilitation process, the VRC uses **VA Form 28-0957** to guide the orientation on veterans' rights and the rehabilitation plan.

---

## 10. COUNSELOR BEHAVIORAL STANDARDS

### What the Counselor Is Supposed to Do (How They Should Act)

**Professional conduct requires:**

1. **Individualized assessment** — Every veteran must be evaluated as an individual, not processed through a cookie-cutter approach
2. **Empathetic listening** — The counselor should actively listen to your goals, barriers, and concerns
3. **Non-judgmental approach** — They should not dismiss or discourage your career aspirations
4. **Thorough exploration** — They must explore all viable vocational options, not just the cheapest or easiest
5. **Inform, don't gatekeep** — They must inform you of ALL available services, not hide options
6. **Accommodate disabilities** — For veterans with PTSD, TBI, or mental health conditions, the counselor should provide enhanced individualized support
7. **Follow up** — They should not leave you hanging; they must monitor your progress and be responsive

### What Counselors Are NOT Supposed to Do

Congressional testimony and advocacy reports document these violations:

1. **Steering veterans away from schools based on cost alone** — Counselors have been caught denying Ivy League schools while approving for-profit schools at similar costs
2. **Discouraging graduate/professional degrees** — One veteran reported a counselor stating: "We don't say the word 'doctor' around here"
3. **Rushing through evaluations** — A 20-minute intake is not a "comprehensive evaluation"
4. **Being unresponsive** — Veterans report difficulty reaching counselors and "unacceptably high wait times"
5. **Giving contradictory directions** — Multiple reassignments across counselors lead to "contradictory and confusing directions"
6. **Arbitrary denials** — Denying services without the "compelling evidence establishing infeasibility beyond any reasonable doubt" required by 38 CFR 21.53
7. **Failing to document** — Not writing up findings on 28-1902b and 28-1902n
8. **Not explaining appeal rights** — Failing to inform veterans of their right to appeal adverse decisions

---

## 11. WHAT HAPPENS AFTER INTAKE — PLAN DEVELOPMENT

### If You Are Found Entitled

1. **VRC assigns you to a program track** (one of the 5)
2. **You and the VRC develop your IWRP together** — this is YOUR plan, developed cooperatively
3. **The IWRP outlines:**
   - Your vocational goal
   - The services VA will provide (education, training, counseling, etc.)
   - The timeline for achieving your goal
   - Your responsibilities
   - Benchmarks and milestones
4. **You enter "Evaluation and Planning" status** in the case management system (38 CFR 21.180)
5. **A case manager is designated** — this may be the same VRC or a different one
6. **The case manager stays with you** throughout your entire rehabilitation program

### If You Are Denied

1. **You receive written notification** per 38 CFR 21.420 with all 7 required elements
2. **You have at least 30 days** to review and respond
3. **You can request an informal meeting** with a VA representative
4. **You can submit additional evidence**
5. **You can appeal** — the VRC is supposed to explain your appeal options

### Extended Evaluation (If Feasibility Is Unclear)

If the VRC can't determine feasibility at initial evaluation:
- **Extended evaluation period:** Minimum 2 weeks, maximum 12 months initially
- **Extension possible:** Up to 6 additional months if feasibility can likely be determined
- **During extended evaluation:** VA provides services while assessing whether a vocational goal is feasible
- **The burden stays on VA** — they must prove infeasibility, not you proving feasibility

---

## 12. KNOWN DEFICIENCIES — WHAT GOES WRONG

Based on VA OIG reports, GAO audits, and Congressional testimony:

### Staffing Crisis
- Target ratio: 1:125 counselors to veterans
- Actual ratio: 1:175 (as of July 2025)
- Recommended by advocates: 1:85
- Backlog: Over **186,000 pending cases** (up 52% over five years)
- One counselor testified: "I really do try and assist everyone, but it is a daunting task!!"

### Documentation Failures (VAOIG-23-03328-197)
- OIG found accuracy of entitlement determinations **cannot be assessed** because counselors aren't documenting properly
- This means you can't even tell if the counselor made the right decision because they didn't write down their reasoning

### Training Deficiencies (VAOIG-23-00967-64)
- VR&E counselors were not trained on specific programs they were authorizing veterans to attend
- Counselors didn't verify facility codes before authorizing enrollment
- 31 participants were improperly sent to unapproved programs

### Mental Health Accommodation Failures
- Congressional testimony noted veterans with mental health conditions and TBI "show poorer outcomes than those with physical disabilities"
- Enhanced individualized support is "not consistently provided"

### Follow-Up Failures
- Employment monitored only **60 days** post-placement
- Veterans losing jobs after 60 days may not get help
- Advocates recommend minimum 6 months to 1 year follow-up

### Inconsistency Across Offices (GAO-20-28, Dec 2019)
- VA checks the quality of plans but **does NOT assess consistency from counselor to counselor**
- Professional judgment introduces "the potential for personal bias and inconsistent plans for veterans with similar circumstances"
- VA has **never assessed** whether different counselors apply evaluation criteria consistently
- GAO recommended VA compare counselors' responses to identical hypothetical cases — VA concurred but implementation unknown
- Decisions vary significantly by counselor and regional office
- Veterans experience "retraumatization" through repetitive applications across multiple offices

### Informed Consent Violations
- M28R requires the VRC to **secure written informed consent** to collect sensitive and confidential information BEFORE proceeding with evaluation
- Advocacy sources (DisabledVeterans.org / attorney Benjamin Krause) report this requirement is **frequently NOT properly satisfied**
- Veterans are often not informed that **everything they say is being logged** into a system of legal records for use in adjudications
- Veterans confuse the VRC role with that of a therapist — they don't realize it's an adjudicative interview

### Privacy Environment Violations
- Per M28R Part II, counseling must be in an environment with **auditory and visual privacy**, free from public observation and unannounced interruptions
- Group orientations sometimes blur into what should be private counseling sessions

### Counselor Reassignment Problems (Dec 2024 Congressional Hearing)
- Veterans report being **reassigned to 4 different counselors** over 2 years "without any prior warning or explanation"
- Veterans working with **multiple counselors had 27% lower success rates**
- "Counseling is not happening" in some cases — VRCs spend excessive time on administrative tasks
- Some counselors approve courses without verifying alignment; others withhold approval arbitrarily
- "If a veteran does not follow through, the veteran is removed from the program. If the counselor does not follow through, there is no action taken."

### Oregon Regional Office Specific Finding
- Oregon VR&E office **failed to send required communications** regarding forms (VAF 28-1902W and VA 10-5345)
- **Closed applications without proper notice** to veterans
- Violated **38 CFR 21.32** (notification requirements when a claim is filed)

### Performance Reporting Manipulation (2011 Congressional Hearing)
- VA claimed 75.8% rehabilitation rate for FY 2010
- GAO-verified calculation showed actual rate was **18%** — not 76%
- Discrepancy caused by inflated denominator/numerator definitions
- The 60-day employment metric is inadequate for measuring long-term success
- **37% of veterans who apply never attend their initial appointment**

---

## 13. YOUR RIGHTS DURING INTAKE

### You Have the Right To:

1. **A thorough, individualized comprehensive evaluation** — not a rush job (38 CFR 21.50)
2. **Be fully informed** of all available services and your responsibilities (38 CFR 21.362)
3. **Written notification** of any adverse decision with all 7 required elements (38 CFR 21.420)
4. **30 days to review** before any adverse action is implemented (38 CFR 21.420)
5. **An informal meeting** with a VA representative before adverse action (38 CFR 21.420)
6. **Access to evidence** used in making the decision (38 CFR 21.420)
7. **Appeal any adverse decision**
8. **Have favorable findings protected** — they can't be reversed without proving clear and unmistakable error (38 CFR 21.420)
9. **Request an extended evaluation** if feasibility is unclear — VA must provide services during this period
10. **Have the burden of proof on VA** for infeasibility — they need "compelling evidence beyond any reasonable doubt" to deny you (38 CFR 21.53)
11. **Change tracks** if your disability worsens or objectives change
12. **Receive services during assessment** — if feasibility criteria aren't met but infeasibility hasn't been proven, VA SHALL provide services (38 CFR 21.53)
13. **Cooperate at your own pace** — VA must make "reasonable efforts" to secure cooperation before suspending evaluation (38 CFR 21.50(d))
